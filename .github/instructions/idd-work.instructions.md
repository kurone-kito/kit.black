# IDD — Work and Self-Review Phase (B + C)

Read this file after a successful claim. It covers worktree creation (B1),
planning (B2), implementation (B3), and the self-review loop (C).

---

## B1 — Create worktree (with branch)

Before creating, check for local conflicts in this order:

1. Ensure the local `main` branch is up to date and has no local
   commits. Run this from the primary worktree while on `main`:

   ```sh
   git fetch origin main
   git log origin/main..main --oneline
   ```

   If the second command outputs any lines, local `main` has unpushed
   commits — stop and report, do not force-reset `main`. Otherwise,
   fast-forward to origin:

   ```sh
   git merge --ff-only origin/main
   ```

   After this `main` fast-forward, do **not** change the primary
   worktree's HEAD off `main` for any reason during B1. Commands that
   run from the primary worktree are allowed as long as HEAD stays on
   `main` — these include read-only inspection (`git worktree list`)
   and the HEAD-preserving branch/worktree commands used by Steps 2-3
   below and by Worktree creation
   (`git branch -d <stale-branch>`, `git worktree add`,
   `wt switch --create`).
   What must not happen is the primary worktree's HEAD switching to
   the issue branch. See Anti-patterns below.

2. Run `git worktree list` — if a worktree for the branch already
   exists, either reuse it (takeover) or remove it first using the exact
   path shown in the list: `git worktree remove <path-from-list>`. (Must
   remove the worktree before deleting the branch — git prevents
   deleting a branch checked out in a worktree.)
3. Run `git branch --list {branch-name}` — if the branch still exists
   locally after step 2, check whether it is an inheritable branch
   (claim takeover). If it is inheritable, reuse it. If it is not
   (unexpected leftover), delete it first:
   `git branch -d {branch-name}`. If deletion is refused (unmerged
   commits), check whether a remote branch or open PR exists for this
   branch — if so, treat it as inheritable and reuse it. If not, post a
   hold comment and stop for manual cleanup; do not force-delete without
   confirming no remote or PR claim is tied to it.

Then create the worktree as described below. If this is a takeover,
reuse the exact branch name from the existing claim comment — do not
generate a new one.

### Anti-patterns

The following commands MUST NOT be used to create the implementation
branch in the primary worktree:

- `git switch -c <branch-name>` — switches the primary worktree to
  the issue branch and skips worktree creation entirely.
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>` — equivalent failure mode.
- A standalone `git branch <branch-name>` followed by in-place commits
  in the primary worktree — defeats the sibling-worktree invariant
  even though `git branch` alone does not move HEAD.

The primary worktree's HEAD MUST remain on `main` throughout B1. The
implementation branch exists only inside the sibling worktree created
by `git worktree add` (or WorkTrunk's `wt switch --create`). If the primary
worktree ever leaves `main` during B1, stop immediately and follow the
B1 self-check repair path below.

### Worktree creation

**Naming convention**: the worktree directory lives as a sibling of the
repository root. Compute the path as
`../<repo-name>.<normalized-branch>` where `<normalized-branch>` is the
branch name with every `/` replaced by `-`.

Example: repo `kit.black`, branch `issue/123-add-foo` → worktree path
`../kit.black.issue-123-add-foo`.

**Step 1 — Check for orphaned path**: if the target path already exists
but is not listed in `git worktree list`, stop and report for manual
cleanup before continuing.

**Step 2 — Create**: use **WorkTrunk** if available. The create verb is
`wt switch --create` (the older `wt new` subcommand was removed):

- macOS/Linux: `wt switch --create -b <base-branch> <branch-name>`
- Windows: `git-wt switch --create -b <base-branch> <branch-name>`, or the
  same `wt switch --create -b <base-branch> <branch-name>` if `git-wt` is
  unavailable

`<base-branch>` is normally `main`. In a **non-interactive / automation**
context, append `-x <noop>` (for example `-x true`): otherwise WorkTrunk
tries to change the caller's directory, warns "Cannot change directory —
shell requires restart", and can hang; `-x` makes it create → run the
pre-start hook → exit cleanly. Describe the current verb rather than pinning
a WorkTrunk version.

If WorkTrunk is not available, choose the correct case:

| Case                                       | Command                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fresh claim                                | `git worktree add <path> -b <branch-name> origin/main`                              |
| Takeover — local branch exists             | `git worktree add <path> <branch-name>`                                             |
| Takeover — remote branch only              | `git fetch origin && git worktree add <path> -b <branch-name> origin/<branch-name>` |
| Takeover — neither local nor remote (rare) | treat as fresh claim; preserve the inherited branch name                            |

**Step 3 — Install deps**: after worktree creation, ensure dependencies
are installed:

- **WorkTrunk with a pre-start install hook** (e.g.,
  `[pre-start].install` in `.config/wt.toml`): dependencies are
  installed automatically — skip this step.
- **Manual `git worktree add` or WorkTrunk without a hook**: `cd` into
  the newly created worktree, then run **install-deps**.

`install-deps` must remain safe to rerun during retries, takeovers, and
recreated worktrees without manual cleanup.

### B1 self-check

Before continuing to B2, verify all of the following:

- `git -C <primary-worktree-root> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns
  `main`.
- `git worktree list` includes the new sibling worktree path.
- The agent's current working directory is the new sibling worktree
  path, not the primary worktree.

If any check fails, the B1 worktree-creation contract has been
violated. Stop and post a hold note on the issue describing which
check failed; do not continue to B2 from the primary worktree. Repair
by removing the misplaced branch from the primary worktree (after
confirming no work is lost) and recreating the sibling worktree
through the Worktree creation steps above.

## B2 — Create and refine plan

### B2.0 — Supersession re-check (before planning)

A4.5's duplicate/supersession check ran once, at pre-claim triage. Under
concurrent execution a sibling PR can ship the whole deliverable during the
claim→plan gap, so re-check once the B1 worktree exists and **before writing
any code or drafting the plan below**. This uses a mechanical file/close-based
signal that is deliberately stronger than the A4.5 title/declaration heuristic;
a weak **title-only** match is **not** a hit here. Keep it cheap: one fetch plus
a bounded merged-PR scan.

1. `git fetch origin main`.
2. **Closed-by-a-merged-PR signal**: re-fetch the issue; if it is now closed
   with a linked closing PR, the deliverable already shipped:

   ```sh
   gh issue view state,closedByPullRequestsReferences \
     --jq 'select(.state == "CLOSED") | .closedByPullRequestsReferences[].number' < number > --json
   ```

3. **Same-target-files signal**: otherwise scan PRs merged **at or after the
   active claim's `created_at`** (a small bounded window) and check whether any
   changed a file the issue scopes under its `## Candidate files`:

   ```sh
   gh pr list --repo merged \
     --search "merged:>=<claim-created-at>" --json number,mergedAt --limit 50 < owner > / < repo > --state
   
   # then, for each candidate, compare its files to the issue's Candidate files:
   gh pr view files --jq '.files[].path' < n > --json
   ```

**On a hit → verify-then-close** (never silent re-implementation, and never an
auto-close on a weak signal): confirm the issue's acceptance criteria already
hold on current `main`, then close the issue with a comment referencing the
superseding PR. If the criteria only **partly** hold, keep the issue open,
record the overlap, and plan only the genuinely-remaining work. On no hit,
continue with the plan below.

Draft an implementation plan and post it as an issue comment. Then run a
critique pass to review the plan for correctness and concreteness (see
`idd-overview-appendix.instructions.md` for per-agent implementation). Post the
refined final plan as a follow-up or update to the same issue comment.
After the final plan comment is posted and claim ownership is
re-validated, update the issue live status digest: `Phase` is `B2
planned`, `Open blockers` is `none` unless the plan found a blocker,
`Next action` is `B3 implement`, and `Authoritative by` points to the
plan comment and verified claim.

## B3 — Implement

Implement the plan. Before each commit, run **fix-validate**.

Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit.

If B3 or C must stop for a hold, use the shared Hold / suspend rules in
`idd-overview-appendix.instructions.md` and update the issue digest with the
blocking condition before stopping. Do not use the digest as the only
record of unfinished work; material decisions still need issue comments
or commits.

---

## C — Self-Review Loop

**Skip condition C2**: if the critique pass finds zero issues, skip to
`idd-pr-submit.instructions.md`.

**Skip condition C4**: if Accept count is zero, or if the loop has run
more than `critiqueLoop.cPhaseLowSeveritySkipAfter` times (distributed
default: `3`) and all remaining Accepts are severity Low (minor
improvements unrelated to PR intent), skip to
`idd-pr-submit.instructions.md`.

### C1 — Critique pass

Run a critique pass on this branch's diff. Ask it to check whether the
implementation is correct, whether the issue's requirements are
satisfied, whether adequate test coverage exists, and whether any other
problems exist. See `idd-overview-appendix.instructions.md` for per-agent
implementation. The distributed defaults for the C-phase skip and loop
guards are listed in `docs/policy-constants.md`.

After each critique loop decision, update the issue digest only if the
next action changes materially: for example, `C accepted fixes` before
C5, `C clean` before moving to PR submission, or a hold state when
guardrails stop the loop.

### C2 — Check for issues

If the critique pass reports zero issues → skip to
`idd-pr-submit.instructions.md`.

### C3 — Score issues

For each issue reported, assess severity and relevance to PR intent:

- **High** (safety, correctness, requirement violations, CI stability) →
  **Accept forced**, regardless of PR intent
- **Low** (minor improvements unrelated to PR intent) → **Reject
  recommended**
- **Medium** → judge by context

### C4 — Accept / Reject and loop check

Decide Accept or Reject for each issue. Then check:

- Accept count = 0 → skip to `idd-pr-submit.instructions.md`
- Loop count >
  `critiqueLoop.cPhaseLowSeveritySkipAfter` (distributed default: `3`)
  and all remaining Accepts are Low → skip to
  `idd-pr-submit.instructions.md`

Otherwise continue to C5.

### C5 — Fix accepted issues

Fix all Accepted issues. Run **fix-validate**.

Commit fixes atomically.

### C6 — Return to C1

Go back to C1 for the next review pass.
