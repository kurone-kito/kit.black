- On the web, in games, everyday life, and business systems!
  The meetup is where we can all learn from each other’s
  experiences with bad UI/UX and disappointing designs.
- It’s a relaxed atmosphere, like at a drinking party,
  and we welcome anyone interested in design failures
  to join us and contribute to our collective learning!
