This package is a collection of VRChat-style icons redesigned in
Adobe Illustrator and output in SVG format. They are distributed
as a VPM package for easy use in VRChat and are also available
on the web as Solid.js and React-compatible versions prepared as
[npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40kurone-kito%2Flaunchpad-icon).

Initially, this was part of the VRChat-style UI skin
“[black.kit.vrcui](https://kurone-kito.booth.pm/items/5545750)”
package, but we separated it into an independent package due
to numerous requests.
