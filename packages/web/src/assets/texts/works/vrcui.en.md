It’s the package that the uGUI skin in the VRChat style.

Currently, I am working on updates with the goal of creating an immersive
environment where Visitors can learn interactively. This will be achieved
by incorporating a mockup of LaunchPad into the UI skin,
which will be used in tutorial worlds in the future.

It’s designed to work in VRChat worlds, but the contents are just a
Unitypackage, so you can use it in Unity projects in general,
depending on how you modify it.
