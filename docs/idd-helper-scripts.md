# IDD Helper Script Evaluation

This document records the current decision on optional helper scripts for
the IDD workflow. It exists so future reviews can reference the trade-off
directly instead of re-evaluating the same suggestion from scratch.

## Decision

In the idd-skill source repository, the following optional helpers were adopted:

**Discover & Claim Phase Helpers (Phase 1):**

- `scripts/discover-orphan-filter.mjs` for A0-O orphan issue detection and
  filtering (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#390](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/390))
- `scripts/discover-roadmap-graph.mjs` for A1.5/A2 recursive roadmap graph
  enumeration and classification
- `scripts/discover-readiness-check.mjs` for A3 readiness criterion
  evaluation (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#391](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/391))
- `scripts/discover-viability-gate.mjs` for A4 viability gate evaluation
  across limited scope, clear verification, and autonomous completion
  criteria (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#505](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/505))
- `scripts/discover-shared-file-overlap.mjs` for read-only A4 Step 2
  high-contention shared-file overlap evidence: it flags candidate issues
  whose `## Candidate files` collide with actively-claimed / open-PR work on
  the F-phase bundle instruction files (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#1019](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/1019))
- `scripts/suitability-triage.mjs` for A4.5 seven-check suitability
  evaluation (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#392](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/392))
- `scripts/claim-approval-gate.mjs` for A5(a) issue-author approval
  verification; A5(d) open-PR conflict checks remain manual by design
  (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#393](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/393))
- `scripts/branch-name.mjs` for the A5(e) canonical
  `issue/<number>-<slug>` branch-name slug computation; deterministic and
  network-free (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#901](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/901))
- `scripts/emit-marker.mjs` for emitting the per-cycle `claimed-by` /
  `review-watermark` / `review-baseline` marker bodies (emit-only, no
  network write; referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#900](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/900))
- `scripts/post-idd-marker.mjs` for rendering and POSTing any operational
  marker (`claim` / `unclaim` / `watermark` / `baseline` / `advisory` /
  `advisory-recovery`) via the reliable JSON path that HTML-comment-first
  bodies require (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#1047](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/1047))
- `scripts/resume-claim-routing.mjs` for Resume Step 1 claim-state
  evaluation and takeover routing (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#394](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/394))
- `scripts/resume-route-selection.mjs` for Resume Step 3 PR/CI/review
  state routing (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#395](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/395))

**Work & Submit Phase Helpers:**

- `scripts/branch-conflict-state.mjs` for read-only branch conflict and
  synchronization state classification; used by D/E/F routing to decide
  whether `merge-main`, `hold-unknown`, or no action is needed without
  mutating the worktree or PR branch (added in 0.2.0)

**Review & Merge Phase Helpers:**

- `scripts/review-activity-snapshot.mjs` for read-only E/F review
  activity and CI snapshot metrics
- `scripts/advisory-wait-state.mjs` for read-only advisory-wait evidence
  collection and AW outcome reporting
- `scripts/ci-wait-policy.mjs` for read-only CI wait policy resolution
  and rerun-budget decisions
- `scripts/pre-merge-readiness.mjs` for read-only F2/F3 readiness
  evidence collection
- `scripts/idd-merge-execute.mjs` for the F3 merge gate: a dry-run
  verdict by default and, with `--apply`, the bound merge execution; it
  wraps `pre-merge-readiness` and adds no new decision authority
- `scripts/live-status-digest.mjs` for issue or PR live status digest
  discovery, rendering, dry-run, and claim-checked upsert
- `scripts/audit-pr-cleanup.mjs` for post-merge comment cleanup auditing
- `scripts/minimize-superseded-markers.mjs` for in-flight per-marker
  `minimizeComment` of strictly superseded `review-watermark`,
  `advisory-wait`, or `claimed-by` markers — called by E1 (Step 2),
  advisory-wait AW3-H, and claim takeover after the replacement
  marker is verified

  Per-helper trust model: `minimize-superseded-markers` resolves its
  trusted-author gate with the same `flag > env > config` ladder as the
  evidence helpers (the singular `trustedMarkerActorsSource` names the
  winning source) and stays self-contained so the template copy works
  without `protocol-helpers.mjs`. `audit-pr-cleanup` and
  `forced-handoff-marker` instead **union** the configured sources —
  viewer, flag (where accepted), `IDD_TRUSTED_MARKER_ACTORS`, and the
  config `trustedMarkerActors` list — with the optional
  collaborator-permission trust; their JSON evidence reports the
  resolved viewer-plus-configured list and the plural
  `trustedMarkerActorsSources` mix. Collaborator trust never appears in
  the list itself: both helpers add a `collaborators` source tag when
  collaborator permission actually trusted an author, and
  `audit-pr-cleanup` additionally reports the capability as
  `collaboratorTrustEnabled`. Config-listed actors therefore widen
  trust explicitly while collaborator-permission trust stays opt-in
  (the `IDD_TRUST_COLLABORATOR_MARKERS` environment variable or the
  `trustCollaboratorMarkers` config field)

- `scripts/review-disposition-verify.mjs` for read-only E7 disposition
  marker presence verification across PATH A and PATH B items
- `scripts/disposition-non-review-notices.mjs` for dry-run/apply
  dispositioning of advisory non-review notices (rate-limit / usage-limit)
  and the CodeRabbit summary walkthrough on a PR — emitting or posting the
  canonical E6 `**Rejected** — {bot} did not review HEAD …` per notice and
  `**Accepted** — {bot} summary walkthrough …` per current summary,
  marker-first, idempotently and fail-closed (only classifier-recognized
  notices and the exact summary marker)
- `scripts/resolve-review-thread.mjs` for the E13 write-side disposition:
  post the reply to the review thread that owns a review comment **and**
  resolve that thread in one invocation — dry-run by default, `--apply`
  re-validates the active claim and posts the reply before resolving
  (a failed reply never leaves a silently-resolved thread)

**Operator Recovery Helpers:**

- `scripts/external-check-waiver.mjs` for dry-run/apply generation of
  maintainer-authorized external-check waiver comments tied to an active
  PR claim
- `scripts/force-handoff.mjs` for the interactive TTY-only
  `idd-force-handoff` operator facade that drives issue input, optional
  PR confirmation from live branch state, and final `y/N` consent
- `scripts/forced-handoff-marker.mjs` for low-level forced-handoff
  marker rendering and inspection when maintainers need the canonical
  payload without the interactive facade

**Post-Merge Audit Helpers:**

- `scripts/merged-pr-feedback-sweep.mjs` for read-only detection of
  unresolved / unaddressed advisory feedback on merged PRs, fed manually to
  the issue-authoring skill (referenced in
  [kurone-kito/idd-skill#931](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/931))

**Utility and Diagnostic Commands:**

The following commands are shipped alongside the issue-loop helpers but are
not phase helpers. They are support utilities and are distinguished here so
future inventory reviews do not need to re-infer their role from code.

- `scripts/idd-doctor.mjs` (`idd-doctor`) — onboarding and configuration
  diagnostics; reads repository config and helper runtime wiring, reports
  gaps without mutating any state. Its post-merge cleanup-backlog check
  scans merged PRs in a default 14-day window with one serial `gh api`
  call per PR and streams per-PR progress to stderr (stdout, including
  `--json`, stays clean). For a local run during a merge burst, pass
  `--cleanup-backlog-window-days 1` to keep it fast, mirroring CI.
- `scripts/helper-runtime-manifest.mjs` (`idd-helper-bundle-manifest`) —
  import helper and manifest inspector; emits machine-readable helper wiring
  for `package-manager`, `vendored-node`, and `ephemeral-npx` profiles.
- `scripts/phase-id-resolver.mjs` (`idd-phase-id-resolver`) — phase ID
  normalization utility; resolves canonical phase IDs from aliases and
  validates token format.

### Discover Roadmap Graph Contract

`scripts/discover-roadmap-graph.mjs` evaluates the recursive A1.5/A2
roadmap graph for one selected roadmap issue. It also offers an additive
cross-roadmap autopilot discovery mode (`--all-roadmaps`) that unions the
open execution leaves across every open roadmap root; the single-root
default below is unchanged.

- **Inputs**: `--issue <number>`, with optional `--owner <owner>`,
  `--repo <repo>`, and `--policy <path>`. `--issue` and `--all-roadmaps`
  are mutually exclusive; exactly one mode must be selected. Passing both,
  or neither, is an error.
- **JSON output**:
  - `root`: `{ number: number, title: string, state: string,`
    `classification: "roadmap" | "execution", roadmapMarkerId: string }`
  - `nodes`: `[{ number: number, title: string, state: string,`
    `labels: string[], classification: "roadmap" | "execution",`
    `roadmapMarkerId: string, depth: number }]`
  - `edges`: `[{ source: number, target: number, relationship: string,`
    `evidence: string }]`
  - `provenancePaths`: `[{ target: number, path: number[] }]`
  - `roadmapNodes`: `number[]` — nested roadmap nodes discovered through
    traversal; **excludes** the root roadmap (A1 traversal entry point)
  - `executionCandidates`: `number[]`
  - `diagnostics`: `{ duplicateReferences: object[], cycles: object[],`
    `inaccessibleReferences: object[], unresolvedReferences: object[] }`
  - `summary`: `{ rootNumber: number, nodeCount: number, edgeCount: number,`
    `roadmapNodeCount: number, executionCandidateCount: number,`
    `duplicateReferenceCount: number, cycleCount: number,`
    `inaccessibleReferenceCount: number, unresolvedReferenceCount: number,`
    `maxDepth: number }`
- **Cross-roadmap autopilot mode (`--all-roadmaps`)**: discovers every
  **open** roadmap root (an open issue carrying the `roadmap` label **or**
  an `<!-- kit-black-roadmap-id: ... -->` marker), runs the
  single-root enumeration above from each root, and returns a **union** of
  open execution leaves. The output shape differs from single-root mode:
  - `mode`: `"all-roadmaps"`
  - `roots`: `[{ number: number, title: string, state: string,`
    `roadmapMarkerId: string }]` — every open roadmap root enumerated
  - `leaves`: `[{ number: number, title: string, state: string,`
    `labels: string[], classification: "execution",`
    `roadmapMarkerId: string, autopilotSuitability: number | null,`
    `effort: "S" | "M" | "L" | null, sourceRoots: number[] }]` — the union of
    open execution leaves. Each leaf records every roadmap root it is reachable
    from in `sourceRoots` (provenance); a leaf shared by sibling epics appears
    **once** and is never double-counted.
  - **Opt-in leaf annotations** (additive; absent flags leave the leaf shape
    byte-stable and make no extra API call). `--with-claim-state` adds
    `activeClaim` (always an object: `{ present, stale, claimId, agentId }`,
    plus `ownedByCurrentSession` when `--current-claim-id` is passed) and
    `claimEligible: boolean` on each open leaf. `--with-readiness` adds
    `readiness: { ready: boolean, reasons: string[], authoringHeld: boolean,`
    `startable: boolean }` — the A3 startability of each open leaf (dependency
    resolution across visible `Blocked by #N` / `Depends on #N` / task-list refs
    and hidden `kit-black-blocked-by` markers, plus
    authoring-hold), where `reasons` lists the sorted filter reasons (e.g.
    `blocked_by_open_issue:#N`) and is empty when `ready`, and `startable` is
    `ready` **and** not claim-blocked (it folds
    in `claimEligible` when `--with-claim-state` also ran; otherwise claim
    eligibility is unknown and treated as non-blocking). `authoringHeld`
    reports label **presence** only — `--with-readiness` does not compute the
    stale-authoring warning (it would cost a discarded per-leaf timeline fetch
    and does not change startability). Both annotations are **soft** discovery
    hints — the A3/A4/A4.5/A5 gates remain authoritative.
  - `diagnostics`: same four buckets as single-root mode, deduped across
    every per-root enumeration.
  - `summary`: `{ rootCount: number, leafCount: number,`
    `scoredLeafCount: number, sharedLeafCount: number,`
    `duplicateReferenceCount: number, cycleCount: number,`
    `inaccessibleReferenceCount: number, unresolvedReferenceCount: number }`.
    Under `--with-readiness` the summary additionally carries
    `startableCount` and `readyCount` (integers aggregating the leaves'
    `readiness.startable` / `readiness.ready`), so a swarm controller reads
    "is there more startable work?" without iterating every leaf; both are
    absent otherwise so the flag-absent shape stays byte-stable.
  - **Ranking** (global-by-score): `leaves` is sorted by
    `autopilotSuitability` **descending**, tie-broken by issue number
    **ascending** (stable). A missing or out-of-range score is treated as
    the configured suitability floor for ordering so unscored work is not
    buried, but a coherently scored leaf never ranks below an unscored leaf
    at the same effective value — scored work always sorts first at a tie.
    The score is an advisory ranking hint only; it never replaces the
    A4.5 suitability gate or the A5 claim safety checks.
- **Error conditions**: missing `--issue` (and no `--all-roadmaps`),
  combining `--issue` with `--all-roadmaps`, unknown flags, an unreadable
  root roadmap, or incomplete `subIssues` GraphQL data throw. Missing or
  inaccessible descendants are reported in `diagnostics` instead of
  crashing.
- **Behavior boundary**: the helper is evidence-only. It may read issue
  bodies and GitHub sub-issue relationships, but it must not claim
  issues, edit roadmap bodies, close roadmap nodes, or decide readiness
  by itself.
- **Runtime / read timing**: the helper is **long-running** on large
  roadmaps — it issues many sequential API calls and emits the whole graph
  in a single final stdout write, with no progress line or completion
  sentinel. Redirect stdout to a file and wait for process exit before
  parsing; a zero-byte or partial read from a still-running (or
  just-finished) helper means **"still running," not** an A2 enumeration
  failure.

### Discover Readiness Sweep (`--swarm-floor`)

`scripts/discover-readiness-check.mjs --swarm-floor <N>` is the canonical
end-of-session "is any startable work left?" one-liner. It ignores
`--issue` / `--issues`, sweeps **every** open issue in the repository
(orphans included, pull requests excluded), runs the same A3 readiness plus
autopilot-suitability evaluation, and reports the issues that are ready
**and** at or above floor `N`:

```sh
node scripts/discover-readiness-check.mjs --swarm-floor <N>
```

- **Output**: `{ eligible, eligible_count, total }` — `eligible` is the
  ready-and-at/above-floor set (each `{ number, title, autopilotSuitability,
belowFloor }`), `eligible_count` its length, and `total` the number of open
  issues swept. A "no score" issue is never below floor, matching the
  discovery ranker, so it stays eligible.
- **Use**: an `eligible_count == 0` result means Discover has no startable
  work at floor `N`, so an autopilot / swarm loop may stop scriptably.
- **Floor range**: `N` is the autopilot-suitability 1-5 band. A non-integer
  or out-of-range `N` is a **hard error**, not a silent coercion to the
  default floor — otherwise a typo (e.g. `--swarm-floor 50`) would quietly
  answer at floor 3 and be misread as "floor-50 work exists."
- **Boundary**: read-only and advisory — selecting the next issue still runs
  the A3/A4/A4.5/A5 gates. Optional flags: `--owner` / `--repo` / `--policy`
  / `--now`.

### Discover Viability Gate Contract

`scripts/discover-viability-gate.mjs` evaluates the A4 viability gate for
one or more issues.

- **Inputs**: `--issue <number>` (repeatable) or `--issues <n1,n2,...>`,
  with optional `--csv`, `--owner <owner>`, and `--repo <repo>`.
- **JSON output**:
  - `viable`: `[{ number: number, title: string }]`
  - `discarded`: `[{ number: number, title: string,`
    `failedCriteria: string[], criteria?: [{ id: string, name: string,`
    `result: "pass" | "fail", evidence: string }] }]`
  - `summary`: `{ total: number, viableCount: number,`
    `discardedCount: number, discardedByCriterion: Record<string, number> }`
- **Error conditions**: missing issue arguments or unknown flags throw;
  loader or GitHub failures surface as errors; not-found or non-open
  issues are reported in `discarded` with `failedCriteria` instead of
  crashing.
- **Example**:

  ```json
  {
    "discarded": [
      {
        "number": 124,
        "title": "rewrite workflow",
        "failedCriteria": ["limited_scope", "autonomous_completion"]
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total": 2,
      "viableCount": 1,
      "discardedCount": 1,
      "discardedByCriterion": { "limited_scope": 1, "autonomous_completion": 1 }
    },
    "viable": [{ "number": 123, "title": "trim helper docs" }]
  }
  ```

### Discover Shared File Overlap Contract

`scripts/discover-shared-file-overlap.mjs` is the read-only file-contention
companion to the `discover-roadmap-graph` `--with-claim-state` claim-eligibility
annotation. For a set of candidate issues it reports the high-contention shared
files each would touch (parsed from its `## Candidate files` section) and
whether any overlap an actively-claimed or open-PR issue, and it emits the soft
A4 Step 2 de-prioritization order. Evidence-only: it claims nothing.

- **Inputs**: `--candidate <number>` (repeatable) or `--candidates <n1,n2>`,
  with optional `--owner <owner>`, `--repo <repo>`, `--policy <path>`,
  `--manifest <path>` (default `audit/sync-manifest.json`), `--bundles
<id1,id2>` (default `bundle-review,bundle-merge`), `--now <ISO8601>`, and
  `--check-overlap`. The cross-issue active-set discovery (open PRs plus the
  claim comments of issues that have a remote `issue/<n>-*` branch, resolved
  with the shared claim-state rules and the configured claim stale age) is
  **gated behind `--check-overlap`** because it adds GitHub API cost; without it
  each candidate's high-contention files are still reported. **Coverage**
  (best-effort, no repo-wide comment scan): open-PR overlap scans open PRs
  (bounded by the `gh pr list` page cap); active-claim overlap covers every
  issue that has a remote `issue/<n>-*` branch (every IDD claim creates one once
  pushed, paginated to the end), so a non-stale claim held by another session is
  detected even when it is outside the unclaimed candidate set being ranked. A
  claim whose branch is not yet pushed is picked up once it appears remotely.
- **High-contention set**: the union of the named bundles' member files plus
  `audit/sync-manifest.json`. Instruction files are keyed by their repo-wide
  unique basename so a source path, mirror path, or bare citation all match.
- **JSON output**:
  - `repository`: `{ owner: string, repo: string }`
  - `checkedOverlap`: `boolean`
  - `highContentionFiles`: `string[]` (sorted)
  - `candidates`: `[{ number: number, score: number | null,`
    `effectiveScore: number, candidateFiles: string[],`
    `highContentionTouched: string[], overlaps: [{ number: number,`
    `reason: "claim" | "pr", files: string[] }], overlapFlag: boolean }]`
  - `recommendedOrder`: `number[]` — candidate numbers after the soft
    tie-breaker (score desc, then non-overlapping first within a score band,
    then issue number). It does **not** apply `discover.selectionDesync`; the
    agent layers the overlap nudge after its own desync pick. Advisory only;
    never a hard gate.
  - `summary`: `{ candidateCount: number, flaggedCount: number,`
    `activeIssueCount: number }`
- **Behavior boundary**: evidence-only and heuristic. `## Candidate files` are
  advisory cues, not an exhaustive manifest, so the overlap signal must stay a
  soft A4 Step 2 tie-breaker — never a claim gate. The written discover
  instructions remain authoritative.

The exported template remains portable without a `scripts/` directory.
Adopters can copy the helper separately when they want the same
repository-local convenience, otherwise the documented GraphQL fallback
remains the portable path.

Absent helper runtime configuration means `instructions-only`. Repositories
that do not opt into helper support should still be able to copy the
Markdown instructions, run the portable shell / `gh` / `jq` procedures,
and complete the workflow without a Node.js dependency.

## Helper Runtime Profiles

When a repository imports the IDD template, helper support should be
selected from one of these profiles:

| Profile             | Intended use                                                                                                                | Dependency model                                                               | Portability expectation                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `package-manager`   | The adopter already uses pnpm, npm, or yarn for the repository.                                                             | Reuse the repository's existing package manager and pre-resolved dependencies. | Preferred when a package manager project already exists; do not fall back to ad hoc `npx` in this mode.                                 |
| `vendored-node`     | The adopter has Node.js available but does not want helper execution to depend on registry resolution at runtime.           | Copy a local helper bundle into the repository during import.                  | Keeps helper execution repository-local while remaining optional.                                                                       |
| `ephemeral-npx`     | The adopter has Node.js available, does not vend helper files, and can resolve a runnable helper command at execution time. | Resolve helper execution through one-shot `npx` commands.                      | Reserved for cases where a published or otherwise resolvable helper command already exists; otherwise fall back to `instructions-only`. |
| `instructions-only` | The adopter does not want or cannot use helper scripts.                                                                     | No helper runtime. Agents follow the Markdown instructions directly.           | First-class supported fallback; no helper config is required.                                                                           |

## Import-Time Selection Order

Helper runtime choice is an import-time policy decision. Use repository
evidence to decide whether helper support should be proposed for
operator confirmation. If helper support is not confirmed, keep
`instructions-only`.

1. If supported `packageManager` metadata or exactly one supported
   lockfile is present, propose `package-manager`.
2. Otherwise, if Node.js is available and the import flow is allowed to
   copy helper files, propose `vendored-node`.
3. Otherwise, if Node.js is available and a published or otherwise
   resolvable helper command exists for one-shot execution, propose
   `ephemeral-npx`.
4. Otherwise, use `instructions-only`.

This selection order exists to keep helper support optional without
turning every adopter into a Node.js-first repository. The written
decision tables remain the canonical protocol regardless of which helper
profile is selected.

## Profile Wiring Surface

Use `idd-helper-bundle-manifest` as the canonical import helper for these
profiles. It is published from this source repository as both
`scripts/helper-runtime-manifest.mjs` and the package bin
`idd-helper-bundle-manifest`, so adopters can inspect one machine-readable
manifest instead of hand-maintaining helper file lists. The manifest's
top-level `recommendation` field uses the same package-manager evidence
class as onboarding: supported `packageManager` metadata or exactly one
supported lockfile can recommend `package-manager`; ambiguous
package-manager signals can still recommend `vendored-node`; otherwise
it stays fail-closed at `instructions-only` and never treats bare
`package.json` presence as enough evidence to assume npm or a real
Node.js helper path.

- `package-manager`: run the manifest from the target repository root and
  let it detect npm, pnpm, or yarn (or pass `--package-manager` if
  detection is ambiguous). The output includes the package-manager
  install command, the `@kurone-kito/idd-skill` helper dependency, and a
  `package.json` scripts block that calls stable `idd-*` bins without
  assuming pnpm.
- `vendored-node`: use the manifest's `managedFiles` list to copy the
  helper bundle into matching paths in the target repository, then run
  the emitted local `node scripts/...` commands. The profile output also
  carries a `recommendedGitattributes` list — one
  `<path> linguist-vendored` line per managed file — to append to the
  adopter's `.gitattributes`, so the vendored bundle is treated as the
  third-party code it is: `linguist-vendored` drops it from language
  statistics and de-prioritizes it in code search. This is the
  adopter-side counterpart of the source repository's own
  `linguist-generated` artifacts; only `vendored-node` vends files, so
  only it emits the recommendation.
- `ephemeral-npx`: use the manifest's one-shot `npx --yes --package
<helper-package-spec> idd-*` commands without copying helper files
  into the repository. The default helper package spec is an HTTPS
  archive URL, and `--package-spec` lets adopters pin a reviewed tarball
  or mirror URL explicitly.
- `instructions-only`: keep helper dependencies, helper files, and helper
  wrapper scripts out of the target repository entirely.

**Authoritative invocation surface per profile.** Under `vendored-node`, the
canonical invocation is `node scripts/<name>.mjs`; the `package-manager` / `npx`
`bin/` facade (the `idd-*` bin wrappers) is **redundant** in this profile and
may be skipped — keeping it only adds a second surface to align with the
instruction files for no portability gain. Under `package-manager` and
`ephemeral-npx`, the `bin/` facade (`idd-*` bins, invoked through the
`package.json` scripts or `npx`) **is** the authoritative surface and should be
retained. `instructions-only` uses neither. When an instruction shows a
`node scripts/...` command, resolve it to your profile's authoritative surface
rather than maintaining both.

To switch profiles later, rerun the manifest with both
`--profile <target-profile>` and `--from-profile <current-profile>`. The
switch section reports the files, dependency entries, and `package.json`
scripts to add or remove for that transition.

The adopted helper boundaries are intentionally narrow:

- `claim-approval-gate.mjs` is read-only, evaluates only the A5(a)
  issue-author approval gate, and emits machine-readable approval
  evidence
- it resolves collaborator permission, ready-label freshness, and
  approval-comment freshness under repository policy, then fails closed
  when ambiguity remains
- it does not claim issues, inspect A5(d) open-PR conflicts, or bypass
  the written claim rules; live PR conflict checks remain manual until a
  stable contract can cover inheritable-branch and linked-issue
  exceptions

- `force-handoff.mjs` is intentionally operator-facing and interactive;
  it asks for the issue number before any mutation, derives whether PR
  input is required from live open PR state on the active claim branch,
  previews the generated marker and successor IDs, and posts only after
  an explicit `y` confirmation
- it must fail closed outside a TTY and is not available to autopilot
  or unattended agent contexts
- it does not replace the forced-handoff policy contract; it is the
  recommended maintainer workflow for producing canonical evidence under
  that contract

- `forced-handoff-marker.mjs` is a lower-level render and inspection
  helper that can plan or emit the canonical marker body for a specific
  issue, claim, branch, and optional PR context
- it is useful for audited debugging and manual inspection, but normal
  maintainer recovery should prefer `idd-force-handoff`
- it does not authorize handoff on its own; the same human-gated policy
  and live-claim validation rules still apply

- `review-activity-snapshot.mjs` is read-only, emits machine-readable
  metrics, and does not evaluate accept/reject dispositions or merge
  decisions
- it does not replace the E/F gate decision tables; it only reduces
  command-copy variance when collecting canonical snapshot fields

- `advisory-wait-state.mjs` is read-only, emits machine-readable AW1-AW3
  evidence plus the computed AW outcome, and never requests reviewers,
  posts markers, or mutates PR state
- it does not replace the advisory-wait decision table; it only reduces
  command-copy variance when collecting canonical AW evidence

- `ci-wait-policy.mjs` is read-only, resolves `ciWait.*` defaults from
  `.github/idd/config.json`, and can evaluate whether the current rerun
  count still permits an automatic rerun
- it does not poll CI, rerun workflows, or replace the CI decision
  table; it only reduces config-copy variance when callers need the
  shared CI wait defaults

- `pre-merge-readiness.mjs` is read-only, emits machine-readable F2/F3
  evidence including review currency, unresolved-thread state,
  unreplied comments, reviewer states, advisory state, CI, claim
  validation, and `waiverEvidence` (parsed external-check waiver comments
  classified as `valid`, `expired`, `wrongHead`, `wrongClaim`,
  `unauthorized`, `malformed`, or `notConfigured` — the last for a valid
  waiver naming a check the policy never declared waivable in
  `ciGate.externalChecks.waivable`; only a `valid` waiver for a
  configured-waivable check is reported with `coveredByWaiver: true` and
  treated as passing by the CI gate)
- it does not replace the pre-merge or merge decision tables; it only
  reduces command-copy variance when collecting canonical merge-gate
  evidence

- `idd-merge-execute.mjs` defaults to dry-run and stays read-only in
  that mode: it reuses `pre-merge-readiness` to evaluate the F3 gates and
  prints `{ ready, blockers, mergeCommand }` without merging
- apply mode (`--apply`) is the only mutating path: when `ready` it
  re-fetches the head SHA and re-validates the claim immediately before
  merging, fails closed (no merge) on head drift or lost claim, and runs
  a merge commit bound to the validated head — never squash or rebase
- it adds no new decision authority (`decisionAuthority: instructions`):
  it does not replace the written F3 gate checklist or decision table,
  and on any helper failure or evidence conflict the agent falls back to
  the manual F3 steps

- `live-status-digest.mjs` defaults to dry-run, supports issue and PR
  targets, and mutates only with explicit `--apply`
- apply mode re-validates an active claim unless a maintainer explicitly
  uses `--skip-claim-check`
- it creates or updates only the single current digest comment and
  refuses duplicate marked digests with repair URLs instead of choosing
  one, deleting, or minimizing audit history
- digest text remains non-authoritative UI state; phase decisions still
  come from trusted markers and GitHub state

- `audit-pr-cleanup.mjs` defaults to dry-run and prints stable JSON
  unless `--format table` is requested
- apply mode is explicit and can re-validate an active claim before
  every minimization mutation
- known review-bot regular comments are considered only after merge and
  only when they match a completed-review or stale-notification signal
- cleanup remains best-effort and never becomes a merge gate
- direct GraphQL fallback commands remain documented in
  `docs/idd-comment-minimization.md`

- `review-disposition-verify.mjs` is read-only, takes a JSON array of
  ReviewItems_snapshot items, and emits per-item verification evidence
- it checks E7 disposition requirements: decision recorded, marker
  present and matching, and thread resolution correct per path and type
- it never posts replies, resolves threads, or mutates any GitHub state
- thread-resolution checks are gated on `type === "review_thread"`;
  non-thread items must have `threadResolved: null`, not `true`/`false`
- PATH A AMD items must have the thread unresolved; PATH A Rejected and
  PATH B items must have review threads resolved
- PATH A Accepted items pass without a marker (reply is handled in
  review-fix, not triage)
- written E7 rules in `idd-review-triage.instructions.md` remain
  authoritative; this helper only reduces command-copy variance when
  confirming marker presence before triage exits

### Non-review-notice disposition (E6 helper-first)

- Command:
  `node scripts/disposition-non-review-notices.mjs --pr <number>`
  (dry-run); add `--apply --claim-issue <n> --claim-id <id>` to post.
  Pass `--advisory-bot-logins` / `--trusted-marker-logins` to override the
  defaults.
- Detects advisory-bot regular comments that the single-sourced
  `isAdvisoryNonReviewNotice` classifier (`protocol-helpers`) recognizes
  (rate-limit / usage-limit), and emits / posts the canonical
  `**Rejected** — {bot-login} did not review HEAD {sha} ({reason}); this
is not a completed review` — marker-first, one comment per notice,
  naming the bot login so the carry-forward attributes it author-scoped.
- **Idempotent**: per advisory bot, existing trusted
  `isNonReviewNoticeDisposition` comments naming that bot already cover
  that many of its notices, so a re-run posts nothing new.
- **CodeRabbit summary walkthrough (#1122)**: it also auto-posts a
  marker-first `**Accepted** — {bot-login} summary walkthrough at HEAD
{sha} …` for the CodeRabbit summary marker
  (`<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: summarize by coderabbit.ai -->`),
  which the gate scores through its general updatedAt-aware pairing rather
  than the notice carry-forward. Because CodeRabbit edits the summary on each
  re-review, the acceptance is re-dispositioned **per HEAD** by timestamp
  (skipped only while a trusted acceptance naming the bot is strictly newer
  than the summary's activity and no older undispositioned non-agent comment
  could consume it under the gate's global pairing), and is skipped outright
  when CodeRabbit
  already reports "No actionable comments were generated" (the gate classifies
  that RESOLVED). It never resolves a review thread — actionable findings stay
  their own threads, gated independently. The body names the bot by its login
  (never the standalone word "CodeRabbit") so per-HEAD re-disposition is
  preserved.
- **Fail-closed**: only classifier-recognized notices are dispositioned;
  real reviews and review threads are never touched. `--apply`
  re-validates the active claim and retries once on a transient post
  failure.
- Stable contract: [`disposition-non-review-notices.schema.json`][disposition-non-review-notices-schema].
- The written E6 non-review-notice rule in
  `idd-review-triage.instructions.md` stays authoritative; this helper is
  the helper-first convenience path with the manual `gh api` fallback
  retained.

### E13 reply-and-resolve (resolve-review-thread)

- Command:
  `node scripts/resolve-review-thread.mjs --pr <number> --comment-id <id>`
  (dry-run); add `--body "<disposition>" --apply --claim-issue <n>
--claim-id <id>` to post the reply and resolve the thread. Optional
  `--owner` / `--repo` / `--agent-id` / `--trusted-marker-logins`.
- Maps `--comment-id` (the review comment's REST id) to its owning review
  thread by matching it against the `databaseId` of the comments inside each
  GraphQL `reviewThreads` node (both the threads and the nested comments
  connections are paginated to completion), then in
  `--apply` posts the reply against the thread's **top-level** comment (REST
  `pulls/.../comments/{root-id}/replies` — GitHub does not support replies to
  replies, so a `--comment-id` naming a later reply still resolves the right
  thread) and resolves the thread (GraphQL `resolveReviewThread`). Reply
  first, resolve second, so a failed reply never resolves the thread without a
  disposition.
- **Dry-run** reports the resolved `threadId` and current `alreadyResolved`
  state without posting; a comment with no owning thread omits `threadId`
  and includes an `error` note.
- **Fail-closed**: `--apply` requires `--body` and the
  `--claim-issue` / `--claim-id` pair, re-validates the active claim before
  **each** of the reply and the resolve (scoped to trusted marker authors,
  aborting on a targeting `forced-handoff`), and binds the mutation to the
  claimed PR by requiring the active claim's branch to equal the PR's head
  branch. GraphQL `errors` fail fast rather than masquerading as a missing
  thread, and a partial apply (reply posted, resolve not confirmed) still
  reports the posted `replyId`.
- Stable contract: [`resolve-review-thread.schema.json`][resolve-review-thread-schema].
- The written E13 reply-and-resolve rule in
  `idd-review-fix.instructions.md` stays authoritative; this helper is the
  helper-first convenience path with the manual REST + GraphQL fallback
  retained.

## Stable Helper Evidence Outputs

### Operator forced-handoff helpers

- Command: `node scripts/force-handoff.mjs`
- Published bin: `idd-force-handoff`
- Contract:

  - interactive TTY only
  - asks for issue input before any mutation
  - asks for PR input only when a live open PR exists on the active
    claim branch and PR-scoped evidence is required
  - prints the generated successor IDs and marker preview before the
    final confirmation
  - posts nothing unless the final confirmation is exactly `y`

- Command: `node scripts/forced-handoff-marker.mjs --issue <number> --plan ...`
- Published bin: `idd-forced-handoff-marker`
- Stable contract:
  [`schemas/forced-handoff-marker.schema.json`](../schemas/forced-handoff-marker.schema.json)
- Intended use:
  - render or inspect canonical forced-handoff marker payloads
  - support audited debugging or manual review of the exact body
  - stay distinct from the interactive operator facade above

The references in this subsection apply only when a repository
explicitly installs the matching helpers and records a human-gated
forced-handoff policy. Repositories that stay on the default disabled
policy must not expose either helper as an active recovery path.

The references in this section apply only when a repository explicitly
installs the matching helper scripts. Repositories that stay on the
default `instructions-only` profile keep using the written shell /
`gh` / `jq` procedures in the phase instructions and do not need a
`scripts/` directory.

### External-check waiver helper

- Command:
  `node scripts/external-check-waiver.mjs --pr <number> --check
<selector> --reason <text> (--expires <iso8601> | --expires-in
<duration>)`
- Published bin: `idd-external-check-waiver`
- Contract:
  - dry-run is the default; the helper prints the canonical comment body
    plus claim/check/authority evidence before any mutation
  - `--apply` posts the PR comment only after verifying the linked
    issue's active claim, the current PR HEAD SHA, the live check state,
    waivable-selector coverage, and maintainer/admin authority
  - non-interactive apply is refused unless `--yes` is provided after a
    prior dry-run review; interactive TTY runs may confirm with `y/N`
  - the helper fails closed when authority cannot distinguish owner,
    Maintain, or Admin from plain Write access, when the requested check
    is not configured in `ciGate.externalChecks.waivable`, or when the
    expiry exceeds `ciGate.externalCheckWaivers.maxValidity`

### External-check waiver contract

Issue `#666` defines the policy and marker contract before the operator
facade and F-phase consumer land. The contract is intentionally
auditable and fail-closed.

```md
<!-- idd-external-check-waiver: {agent-id} {claim-id} {head-sha} check:{check-selector} reason:{reason-token} expires:{iso8601} -->

_{actor}: external check waiver for IDD F phase._
```

Interpretation rules:

- `agent-id`, `claim-id`, `head-sha`, `check`, `reason`, and `expires`
  come from the marker body.
- The issuer is the GitHub comment author and the issued timestamp is
  the comment `created_at`. Do not duplicate either field inside the
  marker body.
- `check` may be an exact selector or a glob pattern, matching the
  `ciGate.externalChecks.*[].selector` plus `matchMode` contract.
- Missing or unparseable body fields, unknown selectors, expired
  comments, wrong HEAD, wrong claim, or untrusted authors must fail
  closed.
- A valid waiver can apply only to checks listed in
  `ciGate.externalChecks.waivable` and only when
  `ciGate.externalCheckWaivers.mode` enables maintainer authorization.
- Repo-owned required checks and GitHub-required checks remain
  non-waivable at the contract layer. An IDD waiver never substitutes
  for GitHub ruleset bypass.
- When the optional facade is installed, prefer helper-first usage:

  - dry-run:

    ```sh
    idd-external-check-waiver --pr 123 \
      --check "CodeRabbit" \
      --reason "rate limit" \
      --expires-in PT2H
    ```

  - apply after review:

    ```sh
    idd-external-check-waiver --pr 123 \
      --check "CodeRabbit" \
      --reason "rate limit" \
      --expires-in PT2H \
      --apply --yes
    ```

  - inspect the rendered body first; do not hand-write or copy raw
    marker comments into the PR
  - in solo-maintainer repositories, this helper-generated comment is
    the authorization path; a normal PR approval is not equivalent

### A4 viability gate

- Command: `node scripts/discover-viability-gate.mjs --issue <number>`
  (repeatable; or `--issues <n1,n2,...>`)
- Optional CSV output: append `--csv` flag
- Stable output schema (JSON mode):

  ```json
  {
    "discarded": [
      { "number": 124, "title": "...", "failedCriteria": ["limited_scope"] }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total": 2,
      "viableCount": 1,
      "discardedCount": 1,
      "discardedByCriterion": { "limited_scope": 1 }
    },
    "viable": [{ "number": 123, "title": "..." }]
  }
  ```

- Stable fields consumed by A4: `viable[].number`, `discarded[].number`,
  `discarded[].failedCriteria`, and `summary.viableCount`
- The helper evaluates the three A4 viability criteria (limited scope, clear
  verification, autonomous completion) against fetched issue bodies; it does
  not post claims or mutate any state

### Claim approval evidence

- Source repo / vendored-node command:
  `node scripts/claim-approval-gate.mjs --issue <issue-number>`
- Package-manager / ephemeral-npx command: use the
  profile-selected `idd:claim-approval-gate` command from the helper
  runtime manifest wiring above
- Optional freshness override: append
  `--generated-plan-updated-at <ISO8601>` when the caller already has
  authoritative generated-plan freshness evidence to reuse
- Stable fields consumed by the instructions: `approved`, `reason`,
  `gateEnabled`, `policy.skipIssueAuthorApprovalGate`,
  `policy.maintainerApprovalActorPolicy`, `policy.approvalSignals`,
  `checks`, and `timelineAvailable`
- `checks` remain stable by `id`: `gate_enabled`,
  `author_self_authorized`, `ready_label_present`,
  `ready_comment_fresh`, and `ambiguity_guard`
- the helper is intentionally scoped to A5(a); A5(d) open-PR conflict
  checks stay on the written live GitHub path because inheritable-branch
  and linked-issue exceptions do not yet have a supported helper
  contract

### Canonical branch name

- Source repo / vendored-node command:
  `node scripts/branch-name.mjs --number <issue-number> --title <issue-title>`
- Package-manager / ephemeral-npx command: use the profile-selected
  `idd:branch-name` command from the helper runtime manifest wiring above
- Prints a single plain line `issue/<number>-<slug>`, implementing the
  `idd-claim.instructions.md` pre-check (e) slug algorithm exactly
  (lowercase, replace `[^a-z0-9]` with `-`, drop empty tokens and the
  whole-token stop-words, rejoin with `-`, apply the 40-character
  mid-token-aware cut, then fall back to `task` when empty)
- Deterministic and network-free; the agent keeps branch-naming authority
  and the written algorithm stays the canonical fallback
- The `tests/branch-name.test.mts` drift test re-derives the pre-check (e)
  "Worked examples" table, so the prose and the helper cannot diverge

### Per-cycle marker bodies

- Source repo / vendored-node command:
  `node scripts/emit-marker.mjs --type <type> <fields...>` where `<type>` is
  `claimed-by`, `review-watermark`, or `review-baseline`
- Package-manager / ephemeral-npx command: use the profile-selected
  `idd:emit-marker` command from the helper runtime manifest wiring above
- Prints the exact ready-to-post marker body (HTML token + visible "Do not
  edit" note) to stdout; **emit-only, no network write** — the agent posts
  it via the documented HTTP path
- Fields per type: `claimed-by` takes `--agent-id --claim-id --supersedes
--timestamp --branch`; `review-watermark` takes `--agent-id --claim-id
--head-sha --max-activity-at --total-item-count --ci-completed-at`;
  `review-baseline` takes `--agent-id --claim-id --sha`
- The written marker formats in `idd-overview-core` (claim) and
  `idd-review-snapshot` (watermark/baseline) stay canonical; the render
  functions live in `protocol-helpers` with byte-shape tests

### Post operational markers (write-side)

- Source repo / vendored-node command:
  `node scripts/post-idd-marker.mjs --type <type> --target <issue|pr> <number> <fields...>`
  (dry-run prints a JSON envelope whose `body` field is the marker); add
  `--apply` to POST it.
- Package-manager / ephemeral-npx command: use the profile-selected
  `idd:post-idd-marker` command from the helper runtime manifest wiring above
- Write-side companion to `emit-marker`: it renders the canonical body for
  each operational marker `<type>` (`claim`, `unclaim`, `watermark`,
  `baseline`, `advisory`, `advisory-recovery`) by reusing the single-sourced
  `protocol-helpers` renderers, then POSTs it as a JSON document
  (`{"body": …}`) via `gh api --method POST .../comments --input -`. The JSON
  path is mandatory because `gh issue comment` / `gh api -f body=` silently
  reject the HTML-comment-first claim-family bodies.
- The `claim` / `unclaim` / `watermark` / `baseline` bodies are
  HTML-comment-first with a visible "Do not edit" note; `advisory` /
  `advisory-recovery` are the **plain-text** `advisory-wait:` /
  `advisory-wait-recovery:` forms (no visible note) so the AW2 / shell-fallback
  recognizers still match.
- Fields per type: `claim` takes `--agent-id --claim-id --supersedes
--timestamp --branch`; `unclaim` takes `--agent-id --claim-id --timestamp`;
  `watermark` takes `--agent-id --claim-id --head-sha --max-activity-at
--total-item-count --ci-completed-at`; `baseline` takes `--agent-id
--claim-id --sha`; `advisory` / `advisory-recovery` take `--agent-id
--head-sha --timestamp`.
- One-command watermark (`watermark` only): `--from-pr <n>` derives
  `--head-sha` / `--max-activity-at` / `--total-item-count` /
  `--ci-completed-at` from a fresh `review-activity-snapshot` of PR `<n>` and
  posts the marker to PR `<n>`, so only `--agent-id` / `--claim-id` (+ `--apply`)
  are still supplied (it always targets the PR; an explicit non-pr `--target`
  is rejected). It maps the snapshot's
  `latestPassingCiCompletedAt` to `--ci-completed-at` (the latest _passing_ CI
  completion, matching the E1 `{latest-ci-completed-at}` contract), forwards
  optional `--trusted-marker-logins` / `--advisory-bot-logins` to the snapshot
  child so its counts match the manual path, and rejects the four manual
  snapshot fields as ambiguous. Unlike the manual dry-run it reads from GitHub
  (it spawns the snapshot), but still posts nothing without `--apply`.
- **No claim/state gating** (the `emit-marker` philosophy): this is a
  single-marker render+POST primitive, so the calling phase must run its
  claim-revalidation gate before `--apply`, exactly as the manual POST path it
  replaces already requires.
- Stable contract: [`post-idd-marker.schema.json`][post-idd-marker-schema].

### Resume claim and route evidence

- Claim routing command:
  `node scripts/resume-claim-routing.mjs --issue <issue-number>`
- Stable fields consumed by resume instructions: `state`, `action`,
  `reason`, `active_claim`, `claim_id_checked`, `stale_age_ms`, `now`,
  `warnings`, and `evidence`
- Stable enums:

  - `state`:
    `unclaimed|already_owned|stale|non_inheritable|disputed`
  - `action`: `re_claim|takeover|keep|stop`

- Step 3 route command:
  `node scripts/resume-route-selection.mjs --issue <issue-number>`
- Stable fields consumed by resume instructions: `route`, `reason`,
  `state`, and `evidence`
- Stable enum:
  - `route`: `D1|D4|E1|E15|Esync|F1|F2|stop`

### Advisory-wait evidence

- Command: `node scripts/advisory-wait-state.mjs --pr <pr-number>`
- Stable contract:
  [`advisory-wait-state.schema.json`][advisory-wait-state-schema]
- Stable fields consumed by the instructions: `prHeadSha`,
  `lastCopilotCommit`, `copilotPending`,
  `copilotPendingCoversHead`, `outcome`, `f3Outcome`,
  `earliestSameHeadAt`, `requestMarkerCount`, `requestCap`,
  `pendingWindowMinutes`, `settledWindowMinutes`,
  `pollIntervalMinutes`, `capExhaustedRoute`, and
  `trustedMarkerSummary`

### CI wait policy resolution

- Source repo / vendored-node command:
  `node scripts/ci-wait-policy.mjs`
- Package-manager / ephemeral-npx command: use the
  profile-selected `idd:ci-wait-policy` command from the helper runtime
  manifest wiring above
- Optional rerun-budget evaluation: append
  `--rerun-count <count>` to the selected command
- Stable fields consumed by instructions or helpers:
  `policy.runningTimeout`, `policy.runningTimeoutMs`,
  `policy.generationTimeout`, `policy.generationTimeoutMs`,
  `policy.rerunPolicy`, and optional `rerunDecision.action` /
  `rerunDecision.reason`
- it remains read-only; the command does not poll CI, rerun workflows,
  or post any GitHub comment

### Merge-gate evidence

- When helper runtime is enabled, these commands are the preferred
  evidence collection path for E1/F2/F3 review-currency and merge-gate
  checks.
- Snapshot command: `node scripts/review-activity-snapshot.mjs`
  with `--pr <pr-number>` and
  `--trusted-marker-logins "<trusted-login-1>,<trusted-login-2>"`
  (optionally `--advisory-bot-logins "<bot-1>,<bot-2>"`; the identity
  also resolves from `IDD_ADVISORY_BOT_LOGINS` or the config
  `advisoryBotLogins` field, with the source echoed in
  `ackOnly.source`)
- Stable E1/F2/F3 snapshot tuple: `headSha`,
  `maxActivityUpdatedAt`, `totalItemCount`,
  `latestPassingCiCompletedAt`, and `counts`
- Additional CI completion field: `latestCiCompletedAt` reports the
  latest terminal run of any state; watermark and merge-gate checks use
  `latestPassingCiCompletedAt`
- Structural ack-only evidence (requires a current helper copy): the
  snapshot and `reviewCurrency.live` emit `ackOnly` (configured bots,
  source, `dispositionsPresent`, `latestDispositionAt`, per-item list)
  and `effective` activity values; `comparisonReason:
ack-only-post-disposition` marks a review-currency pass that relied
  on them. The semantic residual stays with the agent per the
  courtesy-ack convergence rule, and the disposition-evidence and
  unreplied-comment gates are unaffected
- Readiness command: `node scripts/pre-merge-readiness.mjs`
  with `--pr <pr-number>`, `--claim-issue <issue-number>`,
  `--claim-id <claim-id>`, and
  `--trusted-marker-logins "<trusted-login-1>,<trusted-login-2>"`
- Stable contract:
  [`pre-merge-readiness.schema.json`][pre-merge-readiness-schema]
- Stable sections consumed by the instructions: `reviewCurrency`,
  `threads`, `unrepliedComments`, `reviewerStates`,
  `advisoryWait` (including the effective advisory policy fields), `ci`,
  `claim`, and optional `dispositionEvidence`
- Authoritative phase role: the live `pre-merge-readiness` run on the
  current HEAD is the **authoritative source for the final-merge CI and
  activity fields** at F2/F3. The `review-activity-snapshot` helper builds
  the **E-phase** activity universe (E1) for review currency; do not reuse
  its CI/activity values as the F-phase merge decision (they can diverge in
  the pre-merge window)
- `reviewerStates.codeownerSelfApproval` diagnoses whether CODEOWNER
  approval can be satisfied by an eligible non-author owner or an
  applicable ruleset or classic pull-request bypass. `deadlock` and
  `possible_deadlock` statuses should be surfaced in F2 evidence and
  hold comments, but they do not grant bypass permission. The
  `currentUserCanBypass` token records the known GitHub ruleset value
  (`unknown`, `never`, `always`, `pull_requests_only`, `exempt`, or
  `mixed`).
- A `clear` diagnostic means the helper found a GitHub topology that
  appears satisfiable for the current actor; it is still evidence for
  the written F2/F3 gates, not an IDD policy override or permission to
  skip review, CI, freshness, advisory, unresolved-thread, or claim
  checks.
- `reviewCurrency.comparisonRoute` remains advisory evidence only. Agents
  must still apply written instruction checks against live GitHub state.
- Fail closed: if helper execution fails, output is invalid JSON,
  required fields/sections are missing, or helper evidence conflicts with
  live GitHub state, discard helper output and use the portable manual
  fetch path.

### Merge execution (F3)

- Preferred F3 path when helper runtime is enabled: dry-run first to
  inspect the verdict, then `--apply` to execute the bound merge.
- Command: `node scripts/idd-merge-execute.mjs --pr <pr-number>
--claim-issue <issue-number> --claim-id <claim-id>` plus the same
  optional flags as `pre-merge-readiness` (`--agent-id`, `--owner`,
  `--repo`, `--trusted-marker-logins`, `--advisory-bot-logins`); add
  `--apply` to merge.
- Stable contract:
  [`idd-merge-execute.schema.json`][idd-merge-execute-schema]
- It WRAPS the read-only `pre-merge-readiness` collector and adds no new
  decision authority (`decisionAuthority: instructions`). `ready` is
  `true` only when every F3 gate holds: review-currency
  `comparisonRoute == "proceed"`, `threads.actionableCount == 0`,
  advisory `f3Outcome == "SATISFIED"`, CI all-passing (the F2/F3
  no-required-checks fallback included), required/CODEOWNER reviews
  satisfied, claim ownership matches, and disposition evidence both
  routes proceed and is unblocked (`dispositionEvidence.route ==
"proceed"` **and** `dispositionEvidence.blockingCount == 0`; `route`
  alone is not sufficient). Each failing gate is listed in `blockers[]`
  as `{ gate, detail }`.
- Dry-run (default) is read-only: it prints `ready`, `blockers`, and
  `mergeCommand` (a `gh pr merge <pr> --merge --match-head-commit
<validated-head>` bound to the freshly fetched head) and never merges.
  It exits non-zero when not ready.
- `--apply` is the only mutating path. If not `ready` it exits non-zero
  without merging. If `ready` it re-fetches the head SHA and re-validates
  the claim immediately before merging and **fails closed** (exit
  non-zero, no merge, clear message) on any head drift or lost claim.
  Otherwise it runs the merge commit bound to the validated head and
  reports the result. It never squash- or rebase-merges.
- Fail closed: if helper execution fails, output is invalid JSON,
  required fields are missing, or helper evidence conflicts with live
  GitHub state, discard helper output and run the manual F3 gate +
  merge steps in `idd-merge.instructions.md`. The written F3 decision
  table and gate checklist remain canonical.

### E7 disposition verification

- Preferred command when helper runtime is enabled:
  `idd-review-disposition-verify --items '<json>'`
- Source repository equivalent:
  `node scripts/review-disposition-verify.mjs --items '<json>'`
- Input: JSON array of ReviewItems_snapshot items, each with `id`,
  `path` (`"A"` or `"B"`), `type`, `decision`, `markerReply`, and
  `threadResolved`
- Output schema (stable fields):

  ```json
  {
    "failedCount": 0,
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "path": "A",
        "checks": {
          "decisionRecorded": true,
          "markerPresent": true,
          "markerMatchesDecision": true,
          "threadResolutionCorrect": true
        },
        "passed": true,
        "issues": []
      }
    ],
    "passed": true,
    "passedCount": 3,
    "summary": "All 3 items verified.",
    "totalCount": 3
  }
  ```

- Stable fields consumed at E7: `passed`, `items[].passed`,
  `items[].checks`, and `items[].issues`
- Read-only boundary: the helper never posts replies, resolves threads,
  or performs any E6 mutation.
- Fail closed: if execution fails, output is invalid JSON, required
  fields are missing, or output conflicts with observed triage evidence,
  discard helper output and apply written E7 checks directly.

### Branch conflict and synchronization state evidence

- Preferred command when helper runtime is enabled:
  `idd-branch-conflict-state --pr <pr-number>`
- Source repository equivalent:
  `node scripts/branch-conflict-state.mjs --pr <pr-number>`
- Output schema (stable fields):

  ```json
  {
    "branchState": "clean",
    "diagnostics": {
      "mergeableSource": "github-mergeable",
      "conflictFiles": [],
      "notes": []
    },
    "mergeStateStatus": "CLEAN",
    "mergeable": "MERGEABLE",
    "prBaseSha": "def...",
    "prHeadSha": "abc...",
    "prNumber": 123,
    "protocolVersion": "1",
    "published": true,
    "readOnly": true,
    "syncRecommendation": "none",
    "worktreeUnchanged": true
  }
  ```

- `branchState` values: `clean`, `behind-no-conflict`, `content-conflict`,
  `dirty`, `force-push-exception`, `computing`, `unknown` (`computing` is the
  transient still-computing mergeability that callers re-poll; `unknown` stays
  terminal)
- `syncRecommendation` values: `none`, `merge-main`, `policy-required-update`,
  `force-push-exception`, `recheck`, `hold-unknown` (`recheck` pairs with
  `computing`)
- Stable fields consumed by D/E/F routing: `branchState`,
  `syncRecommendation`, `published`, `readOnly`, `worktreeUnchanged`
- Read-only boundary: the helper never runs `git merge`, `git rebase`, or
  any command that leaves merge state, index changes, or working-tree
  changes. The `readOnly` and `worktreeUnchanged` fields confirm this.
- Fail closed: if execution fails, output is invalid JSON, or required
  fields are missing, discard helper output and apply written D4/E-phase
  branch-sync checks directly.

### S2 quiet-window evidence

- When helper runtime is enabled, Resume/S2 should call the
  profile-selected `idd-stalled-session-quiet-check --pr <pr-number>`
  command first. `node scripts/stalled-session-quiet-check.mjs --pr
<pr-number>` is the vendored equivalent.
- Optional parameters: `--now <ISO8601>`, `--quiet-window-ms <ms>`,
  `--claim-created-at <ISO8601>`, and `--policy <path>`
- Stable fields consumed by the instructions: `quiet_window_met`,
  `quiet_window_ms`, `window_start`, `now`, `latest_activity`,
  `latest_activity_type`, `reason`, and `evidence`
  (`activity_count_in_window`, `blocking_activities`,
  `has_heartbeat_in_window`, `has_ci_running`,
  `has_branch_tip_movement`)
- `ci-running` activities always break the quiet window regardless
  of their timestamp; all other types are checked against
  `window_start = now - quiet_window_ms`
- Before takeover, re-run the helper against live GitHub state and pair
  it with the written Resume/S2-S4 checks for the same active claim,
  stale-threshold gating, closed/merged guards, and A5 race-safe claim
  verification. `quiet_window_met = true` alone is never sufficient.

### Merged-PR feedback sweep

- Source repo / vendored-node command:
  `node scripts/merged-pr-feedback-sweep.mjs`
- Package-manager / ephemeral-npx command: use the profile-selected
  `idd-merged-pr-feedback-sweep` command
- A **manually-invoked**, read-only detector (no schedule, no mutation). It
  scans MERGED PRs and surfaces feedback that was left unattended at merge:
  - **Window selector**: `--since <ISO8601>` and/or `--days <N>`, or
    `--pr <n>` (repeatable) / `--prs <n1,n2,...>`; `--limit <N>` caps the
    `--since`/`--days` enumeration. When both `--since` and `--days` are
    given, the later (more recent) cutoff wins, narrowing the window to the
    intersection; `--pr`/`--prs` bypass the date window entirely, so the
    reported `sweepWindow.since` and `days` are then `null`. Optional
    `--owner`, `--repo`,
    `--trusted-marker-logins`, and `--advisory-bot-logins` (same convention
    as `review-activity-snapshot`). `--idd-agent-logins` (or
    `IDD_AGENT_LOGINS`) names the agent accounts whose comments are
    dispositions / are not feedback — distinct from trusted-marker actors so a
    human maintainer who is a trusted-marker actor still has their review
    feedback surfaced; it defaults to the trusted-marker actors. Numeric flags
    reject non-integer values, and the PR connections are paged to completion
    so large PRs do not silently truncate.
  - **Surfaces**: review threads with `isResolved == false` (excluding
    threads the IDD agent itself opened; each carries a `dispositioned` flag
    from the in-thread disposition check), and regular comments /
    `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review bodies from non-IDD-agent authors that have
    **no later IDD-agent disposition** (`**Accepted**` / `**Rejected**` /
    `**Awaiting maintainer decision**`). Trusted IDD operational markers, IDD
    disposition comments, and any HTML comment beginning with `<!-- idd-` (for
    example cleanup-evidence, excluded regardless of author — including CI
    automation such as `github-actions[bot]`) are excluded from the feedback
    set. Each finding carries an `advisoryBot` flag (`isKnownReviewBot` or a
    configured `advisoryBotLogins` author) so the operator can prioritize human
    feedback over capricious advisory-bot noise.
- JSON output keys: `sweepWindow`, `trustedMarkerActors`,
  `advisoryBotLogins`, `iddAgentLogins`, `prs` (each entry has `number`,
  `mergedAt`, `mergeCommit`, `unresolvedThreads`, and `unaddressedComments`),
  and `summary` (`prCount`, `flaggedPrCount`, `unresolvedThreadCount`,
  `unaddressedCommentCount`).
- Read-only boundary: the helper performs no minimization, no posting, and no
  issue creation. **Handoff**: the JSON is the input an operator hands to the
  issue-authoring skill, which re-verifies each candidate against current
  `main` (reuse-first / not-already-fixed) and drafts follow-up issues
  bucketed by readiness. The helper does deterministic detection; the
  judgment-heavy re-verification, drafting, and publish stay operator-gated.

## Friction Inventory

### Ranked roadmap candidate list for the source roadmap

The ranking distinguishes immediate roadmap picks from documented
reserve candidates:

1. **Advisory-wait state** — **implemented now**. The AW protocol had
   the highest command-copy burden, a stable read-only evidence shape,
   and a clear non-goal boundary, so the source roadmap landed it first
   as
   [kurone-kito/idd-skill#308](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/308).
2. **Pre-merge readiness** — **implemented now**. F2/F3 collect the
   largest evidence set in the workflow and already compose existing
   pure protocol logic, making a read-only helper valuable without
   moving merge authority out of the instructions. This maps directly to
   the source follow-up issue
   [kurone-kito/idd-skill#309](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill/issues/309).
3. **Claim-state parsing** — **reserve, defer for now**. The payoff is
   real, but claim ownership drift would be more dangerous than
   shell-copy variance, so this should wait until helper runtime
   profiles and the higher-payoff read-only gates are settled.

### Explicit deferrals

- **Branch protection/ruleset reads** stay deferred for this roadmap.
  They are useful support data, but repository variance and narrower
  byte savings make them a worse first investment than AW/F2 helpers.
- **Live status digest** and **post-merge cleanup** are already adopted
  in narrow forms, so they are inventory baselines rather than new
  roadmap targets.

### Inventory Non-goals

- Do not turn this inventory into a commitment to helperize every phase.
- Do not rank mutating merge or review actions ahead of read-only
  evidence collectors.
- Do not let helper candidates replace the written decision tables.
- Do not use this inventory to justify a separate npm package before the
  local/template profile path is proven.

## Trade-off

Helper scripts can improve copy/paste reliability and make some
review-state checks easier to audit locally. That benefit is real,
especially for advisory-wait, review-snapshot, and post-merge cleanup
commands.

The portability cost is also real. The exported IDD template is meant to
work in repositories that can copy Markdown instruction files without
adopting a runtime, package manager, or repository-local script
directory. If helper scripts are introduced too early, every operational
rule must be maintained twice: once in the instructions that agents read,
and once in code that agents run.

For now, the safer balance is to keep pre-merge and advisory
instructions canonical while allowing three read-only evidence helpers,
one live digest upsert helper, and one post-merge cleanup helper. Merge
safety still depends on the written checks, not on helper output alone.

## Non-goals

This helper policy does **not** imply the following:

- Node.js becomes mandatory for repositories that only copy the Markdown
  instructions
- helper output becomes authoritative over the written decision tables
- helpers perform mutating review or merge actions by default; mutation
  must remain explicit in the written instructions
- the project is committed to publishing a separate npm package before
  the local and templated helper profiles are proven

## Future Adoption Criteria

If additional helper scripts are revisited, they should satisfy all of
the following:

- They are optional and never required to execute the exported template.
- They are read-only by default; mutating actions remain explicit in the
  phase instructions.
- They output stable machine-readable JSON that can be inspected and
  compared by agents.
- They keep the shell / `gh` / `jq` fallback documented beside the helper
  path.
- They have a small test fixture set for marker parsing and snapshot
  filtering.
- They are introduced only after the corresponding instruction protocol
  has stabilized enough that drift risk is lower than command-copy risk.

Good future candidates remain read-only evidence collectors for
pre-merge readiness or later claim-state inspection. They should not
replace the written decision tables.
