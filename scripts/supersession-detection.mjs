// The #1484 high-confidence supersession-detection kernel (#1499): a
// mechanical "is this issue already superseded by a merged PR" evaluator,
// plus its read-only `gh` argv-builders, extracted out of
// `suitability-triage.mts` so a future B2.0 mechanization
// (`idd-work.instructions.md`'s post-claim supersession re-check, currently
// prose-only) can reuse this kernel directly instead of duplicating it in a
// second file. `suitability-triage.mts` is Check 4's only current consumer;
// nothing here depends on it, so this module carries no import back to it
// (a future consumer never needs to pull in suitability-triage.mts's whole
// 7-check CLI just to reuse the kernel).
//
// Pure and I/O-free: `evaluateHighConfidenceDuplicate` only evaluates
// already-collected evidence, and the argv-builders only build `gh` command
// arrays -- neither executes anything. The actual `gh` fetch/orchestration
// (`fetchClosedByMergedPrNumbers`, `fetchMergedPrFileOverlapEvidence`, the
// `MERGED_PR_SCAN_DEADLINE_MS` wall-clock budget) stays in
// `suitability-triage.mts`'s own CLI glue, which the issue does not name as
// part of the extraction.

// Read-only: every function below only ever builds argv for `gh api graphql`
// (with a `query` operation, never `mutation`), `gh pr list`, or `gh pr view`
// (no -X/--method, no issue/PR mutation subcommand) -- none of them execute
// anything themselves. #1484 is detect-only by design; do not add a mutating
// argv-builder here -- a later gated-close follow-up (#1485) is a separate,
// human-gated change. The argv-builders are exported so tests can assert the
// exact read-only verb without shelling out (a compiled-text grep for
// mutating verb literals would miss a `gh api ... -X POST`-shaped mutation,
// since none of these builders produce one).

 * happens in the caller, after this fetch -- without it, an issue with only
