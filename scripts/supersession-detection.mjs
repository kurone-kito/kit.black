// The #1484 high-confidence supersession-detection kernel (#1499): a
// mechanical "is this issue already superseded by a merged PR" evaluator,
// plus its read-only `gh` argv-builders, extracted out of
// `suitability-triage.mts` so a future B2.0 mechanization
// (`idd-work.instructions.md`'s post-claim supersession re-check, currently
// prose-only) can reuse this kernel directly instead of duplicating it in a
// second file. `suitability-triage.mts` is Check 4's only current consumer;
// nothing here depends on it, so this module carries no import back to it
// (a future consumer never needs to pull in suitability-triage.mts's whole
// 7-check CLI just to reuse the kernel).
//
// Pure and I/O-free: `evaluateHighConfidenceDuplicate` only evaluates
// already-collected evidence, and the argv-builders only build `gh` command
// arrays -- neither executes anything. The actual `gh` fetch/orchestration
// (`fetchClosedByMergedPrNumbers`, `fetchMergedPrFileOverlapEvidence`, the
// `MERGED_PR_SCAN_DEADLINE_MS` wall-clock budget) stays in
// `suitability-triage.mts`'s own CLI glue, which the issue does not name as
// part of the extraction.

 * code span or fence is not a realistic false-positive vector for this
 * specific pattern.
 *
 * Defensive against a malformed `pr` shape the same way the rest of this
