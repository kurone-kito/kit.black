// Mechanical provenance check for the review-fix-loop-cutoff auto-release
// exception's precondition (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2877's contract.md
// bullet, kurone-kito/idd-skill#2891): before honoring that exception, a
// releasing session must recompute a target issue's current body-sha256
// from a fresh read and compare it against that same target's own
// `mode=acquire` owner marker's recorded `body-sha256` -- specifically
// the target's *first* trusted `mode=acquire` marker (the Stage 1
// acquire), never a later one. contract.md is explicit that this digest
// is "hashed from the fresh read taken immediately before that marker
// was posted, so it already reflects the published body" -- that
// property holds only for the very first acquire, since every acquire
// (including a legitimate re-acquisition after a full release cycle)
// hashes whatever body is live *at its own posting time*, not the
// originally published one. Anchoring on "whichever generation currently
// owns the target" instead of the first acquire would make the check
// tautological for any edit landing before a later re-acquisition
// (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901 review, chatgpt-codex-connector round 4 --
// see `findStageOneAcquire`'s own doc comment). That comparison
// previously relied entirely on a releasing session's own manual
// judgment; this helper performs and verifies it mechanically instead.
//
// Read-only evidence collector (docs/idd-helper-scripts.md's "Helper
// contract classes"): it never posts comments, applies labels, or mutates
// anything. A releasing session (or a future automated Stage 2
// release-sequence helper) still decides what to do with the verdict.
//
// Per contract.md's "Per-target ownership" section, a target's own
// `authoring-owner` marker is always posted as a comment on that same
// target issue (never on a different anchor issue), so the live body and
// the marker to compare it against always come from the one `--issue`
// argument.
//
// Two accepted limitations, both fail-closed (never a false `pass`), not
// defects: (1) a marker whose own `anchor` differs from its own `target`
// declares itself a multi-target set's non-anchor child, out of scope
// for this single-target-orphan helper (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901
// review, Copilot round 5). (2) tampering with the true Stage 1 acquire
// comment that leaves no `<marker-prefix>-authoring-owner:` trace at
// all -- deleting it outright, or editing it into ordinary prose that
// no longer contains the token -- cannot be detected by a live
// comment-log reader: a deleted comment is absent from every API
// response, and a fully rewritten one is indistinguishable from a
// comment that was always unrelated (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901 review
// rounds 6-7, chatgpt-codex-connector). Detectable tampering -- an edit
// that leaves the token recognizable, even if it breaks parsing or
// changes the target -- does fail closed (`findStageOneAcquire`'s
// pre-pass). contract.md's remedy for the undetectable case is a
// durable record the *authoring session itself* persists in its hold
// state, not an artifact this read-only helper can independently fetch;
// kurone-kito/idd-skill#2891's acceptance criteria scope this helper to
// comparing the live body against the marker's own recorded digest, not
// to designing that separate durable-record mechanism.

 *   general "first valid marker by GitHub comment order wins" rule and
 *   this helper's own round-1/round-3 regression tests.
 *
 * The candidate pool is every trusted, owner-marker-shaped comment
 * (`looksLikeOwnerMarker`) -- not just the ones that happen to parse and
 * match `target` -- sorted into the same deterministic comment order,
 * with the *first* one in that order scrutinized as the Stage 1
 * candidate, whatever its shape:

 * - If ANY owner-marker-shaped comment in the whole pool was edited
 *   (`updatedAt !== createdAt`), the whole log is rejected up front,
 *   before a first candidate is even chosen -- not only when the edited
 *   comment would otherwise have been selected. An editor who edits the
 *   true Stage 1 acquire into something that still carries the marker
 *   token but no longer parses, or retargets it to a different issue,
 *   cannot make it silently drop out of consideration and let a later
 *   (legitimate-looking) acquire win instead (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901
 *   review, Copilot round 6). This is deliberately over-broad in one
 *   direction: an edited `heartbeat` (or any other owner-marker-shaped
 *   comment, for any target) also trips it, even though only the
 *   eventual Stage 1 acquire matters semantically -- accepted, since
 *   contract.md's append-only rule covers "owner comments" generically
 *   and failing closed on any detected edit is the safe direction.
 * - The pool's first comment, once past the edit check, must itself
 *   parse as an `authoring-owner` marker and name `target` -- an
 *   unedited-but-malformed first attempt (a genuine posting error, not
 *   tampering) is rejected rather than silently skipped in favor of a
 *   later, validly-parsing marker, matching "the target's own
 *   `mode=acquire` owner marker" read literally: the log's first
 *   candidate either is that marker or the log is unusable, never a
 *   later marker standing in for it (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901 review
 *   round 7, Copilot: the earlier form filtered the pool down to
 *   parsing, target-matching comments *before* taking the first one,
 *   so a first comment that failed either check simply vanished from
 *   consideration instead of blocking selection).
 * - Once the first candidate parses and matches `target`, every other
 *   Stage 1 validity condition still applies (see
 *   `invalidStageOneAcquireReason`).
 *
 * Undetectable tampering is out of scope, on two related fronts,
 * documented as accepted limitations in this file's header comment: a
 * trusted actor who deletes the true Stage 1 acquire outright (rather
 * than editing it), and one who edits it into ordinary prose that no
 * longer contains the owner-marker token at all. Both leave no trace
 * `looksLikeOwnerMarker` (or any comment-log reader) can detect --
 * indistinguishable from a comment that was always unrelated
 * (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901 review round 6 and round 7,
 * chatgpt-codex-connector).
 *
 * Returns `{ event: null, rejectReason }` (never a false `pass`) when

Mechanically compares a live issue body's sha256 against that same issue's

(kurone-kito/idd-skill#2891). Read-only: never posts, labels, or mutates
anything. --owner and --repo must be given together or not at all.

The comparison anchors on this issue's own trusted, owner-marker-shaped
comments -- every one still containing the case-insensitive
"<marker-prefix>-authoring-owner:" token, whether or not it actually
parses -- taken in deterministic comment order (createdAt, ties broken
by comment id ascending). If ANY of those comments was edited after
posting (its updatedAt differs from its createdAt), the whole log is
rejected up front, before a first candidate is even chosen: an editor
cannot make the true Stage 1 acquire vanish from consideration by
editing it into something unparseable or retargeting it, letting a
later acquire silently win instead (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901 review
round 6, Copilot). This is deliberately over-broad in one direction (an
edited heartbeat, for example, also trips it) since contract.md's
append-only rule covers owner comments generically.

Past that check, the *first* candidate in comment order is scrutinized,
whatever its shape -- not merely the first one that happens to parse and
match this target. It must parse as an authoring-owner marker at all,
name this issue as its own target, and itself be a valid Stage 1
mode=acquire marker, or this reports not-found rather than silently
skipping it in favor of a later, validly-parsing marker
(kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901 review round 7, Copilot). "Valid" means
every condition contract.md attaches to a genuine Stage 1 acquire:
mode=acquire itself (every other mode -- bootstrap, resume, heartbeat,
release, ... -- presupposes a prior acquire, so a well-formed history
never opens with one); supersedes=none (contract.md requires this
specifically for acquire); a real 64-hex body-sha256, never the
shape-valid sentinel "none"; and its own anchor names the same issue as
its own target (a mismatch declares the marker a multi-target set's
non-anchor child, out of scope for this single-target-orphan helper).
Only it, not any later marker, is guaranteed to have hashed the body as
published: a same-generation racer, a bootstrap/resume recovery, or a
legitimate re-acquisition after a full release cycle all hash whatever
body is live at their own posting time, not the originally published
one -- comparing against any of those instead would make this check
pass trivially for a body edited before that later marker
(kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901 review, chatgpt-codex-connector round 4).
target comparisons fold case, since GitHub owner/repo names are
case-insensitive. --verbose surfaces which condition failed in the
acquire_marker_found check's evidence.

Two accepted limitations, both fail-closed (never a false pass): a
marker whose own anchor differs from its own target (a multi-target
set's non-anchor child, out of scope here); and tampering with the true
Stage 1 acquire that leaves no authoring-owner token at all -- deleting
it outright, or editing it into ordinary prose -- which cannot be
detected by a live comment-log reader (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2901
review rounds 5-7, chatgpt-codex-connector and Copilot).

Output schema:
{
  "repository": {"owner": "...", "repo": "..."},
  "issue": {"number": 2891, "title": "...", "url": "..."},
  "target": "owner/repo#2891",
  "verdict": "pass|mismatch|not-found",

  "marker": {"author": "...", "createdAt": "...", "mode": "acquire", "owner": "...", "set": "...", "session": "...", "bodySha256": "<64-hex>"} | null,
  "checks": [{"id":"acquire_marker_found","name":"...","result":"pass|fail"}, {"id":"body_sha256_match","name":"...","result":"pass|fail"}]
}

"not-found" means this issue's own trusted authoring-owner marker log does
not open with a valid mode=acquire marker for this target -- never
treated as a pass. "mismatch" means a valid Stage 1 acquire marker exists
but the live body has changed since its own snapshot.

--verbose adds an "evidence" string to each checks[] entry (the computed
and recorded digests, or the acquire marker's author/timestamp); omitted
by default to keep default output terse.
