// Mechanically audits a drafted GitHub issue body against the
// issue-authoring contract's structural expectations
// (skills/issue-authoring/references/contract.md): the autopilot-suitability
// marker's exactly-one/coherent-value rule, its cross-field agreement with
// the configured blocked-by-human label, markerPrefix consistency across
// every authoring marker, the declared shape's required section headings,
// the roadmap shape's `## Tracks` checkbox lines actually resolving to a
// child issue reference, the roadmap-id/blocked-by dependency-marker
// rules, visible/hidden line agreement for the suitability and effort
// footers, an advisory warning-severity check that flags an issue/PR
// reference used near coordination language (e.g. "before", "once",
// "requires") with no corresponding Blocked-by/Depends-on/task-list
// dependency encoding (see checkProseOnlyDependency), and (given
// pre-fetched comment data) a mechanical count of eligible,
// not-yet-minimized superseded authoring-owner / authoring-publication-intent
// marker comments (see checkAuthoringMarkerMinimizationBacklog, #2896).
// Every advisory/count-only check always reports `result: 'pass'` and
// never changes the exit code.
//
// All marker value parsing is delegated to the existing
// autopilot-suitability.mts / effort.mts / marker-regex.mts /
// policy-helpers.mts helpers; this module only layers shape-aware
// structural checks on top of them. Pure and network-free — the CLI reads
// the drafted body from a file or stdin rather than fetching a live issue.

// Matches a Markdown link whose target is a full GitHub issue/PR URL (e.g.

// issue/PR reference, a bare full GitHub issue/PR URL, or a local
// `owner/repo#123` shorthand — in that order, capturing each URL/shorthand
// alternative's owner and repo so callers can tell a local reference from
// a cross-repo one (see `currentRepo` handling in checkProseOnlyDependency
// below). The Markdown-link alternative is tried (and, being anchored at
// the label's own `[`, wins) first specifically so that a cross-repo
// link's *label* text — which often repeats the same `#N` the URL already
// names, e.g. the `#1391` above — is consumed as part of that one link
// match rather than separately re-matched by the bare-`#` alternative and
// misread as a local reference once the link's URL itself is correctly
// filtered out as cross-repo. Between the issue/PR number and the link's
// closing `)`, the Markdown-link alternative also tolerates an optional
// trailing `/`, an optional URL fragment (`#issuecomment-123`), and an
// optional quoted title (`"..."` or `'...'`) — each bounded tightly enough
// (a matching quote character, or a fragment charset that excludes `)`,
// quotes, and whitespace) that none of them can consume past the link's
// real closing paren the way a naive `.*\)` would. Without this, any of
// those three trailing forms would break the Markdown-link match and let
// the label's own bare `#N` leak through to the bare-`#` alternative
// below, reintroducing the label-leak false positive the Markdown-link
// alternative exists to prevent. `#` alone (as in an ATX heading) never
// matches without trailing digits. The bare-`#` alternative excludes a `#`
// immediately preceded by a word character or `/` (a negative lookbehind),
// so cross-repo shorthand like `other/repo#123` does not match on its
// trailing `#123` — a cross-repo reference cannot be encoded with this
// repository's local `Blocked by` / `Depends on` markers, so flagging it
// here would be misleading rather than actionable. The final `owner/repo#N`
// shorthand alternative recognizes that same shape as a *distinct*,
// dedicated match (rather than leaving it permanently unmatched) so
// checkProseOnlyDependency can apply the currentRepo comparison to it —
// flagging it only when the shorthand names the current repository (see
// the `currentRepo` JSDoc on `AuditOptions` for the reversed-default-
// polarity rationale). It reuses the bare-`#` alternative's own
// `(?<![\w/])` lookbehind so it, too, only starts matching at a natural
// token boundary rather than mid-path (e.g. inside a 3-segment
// slash-separated path that happens to end in `#123`).
//
// The quoted-title sub-pattern tolerates a backslash-escaped quote
// matching the title's own delimiter (`\"` inside a `"..."` title, or
// `\'` inside a `'...'` title) as content instead of letting it close the
// title early: `(?:\\.|[^"\\\n])*` (and the single-quote equivalent)
// tries consuming a backslash plus the character right after it as one
// unit before falling back to "any character that is not the quote, a
// backslash, or a newline", so an escaped quote is never mistaken for the
// real closing delimiter. Without this, a title like `"reviewed
// \"API\""` would close at the first escaped quote, leave the rest of
// the title as unconsumed content before the link's real closing paren,
// fail the whole Markdown-link alternative, and re-leak the label's own
// bare `#N` to the bare-`#` alternative — the same failure mode the
// trailing-content tolerances above already guard against, just
// triggered by escaping instead of an unhandled trailing shape.
//
// The character class excludes a literal backslash (not just the quote
// and newline) so the two alternatives never overlap on the same input
// character: `\\.` is the only alternative that can ever consume a `\`,
// and the class-based alternative is the only one that can consume
// anything else. A version that let the class also match a bare `\`
// (`[^"\n]` alone) would let the engine choose, for every backslash in a
// run of them, between pairing it with the next character via `\\.` or
// consuming it alone via the class — an ambiguity that multiplies
// combinatorially (Fibonacci-many partitions of an N-backslash run) and
// causes catastrophic backtracking once the overall match fails, i.e.
// exponential-time behavior on a long run of backslashes with no closing
// quote (confirmed empirically: a ~30-character adversarial input took
// several seconds under the ambiguous form; a ~10,000-character one
// resolves in under a millisecond after excluding the backslash from the
// class). This is the standard non-overlapping idiom for a
// backslash-escaped quoted string and applies to both quote styles.

 * change at all" -- this file's `audit-authored-issue` gate runs

 * (`skills/issue-authoring/references/workflow-boundary.md`), so without
 * this gate a repository that never enabled the feature could still see
 * a new publish-blocking failure from an incidental `status:
 * upstream-candidate` label applied for an unrelated reason (#2721
 * review, Codex).
 *

 * marker occurrence whose value is not exactly `true`, or that appears
 * more than once (even with agreeing values -- see
 * {@link parseUpstreamCandidateMarker}), is `malformed` and is treated as

 * Counts how many entries in `comments` are byte-exact canonical

 * -- mirroring the "skip the just-posted comment itself" rule the
 * hide-on-supersede sweep (`skills/issue-authoring/references/
 * contract.md`'s "Authoring hold and release" section) already applies.
 * "Newest" is the last matching entry in array order: callers are
 * expected to supply comments in GitHub's deterministic
 * `created_at`-then-id order. This is the first **order-dependent**
 * comment-aware check in this file -- unlike
 * {@link checkAuthoringOwnerMarkerTrail}, which uses order-independent
 * `.some()`/`.every()` scans, this function's result changes if the input
 * order changes. `AuthoringCommentInput.createdAt` is accepted but never
 * consulted here to verify or sort by ascending order; a caller that
 * supplies comments out of order gets a silently wrong count, not a
 * detected error.
 *
 * `family` is matched against the RAW `comment.body` (never
 * `stripMarkdownCodeRegions`-masked): unlike the structural checks above,
 * this count exists to mirror exactly what the live hide-on-supersede
 * sweep would find on the real, unmodified comment body -- a body this
 * function would treat as canonical only by first stripping content out
 * of it is not actually byte-exact against what
 * `matchCanonicalAuthoringMarkerFamily` would see live.
 *
 * When `trustedActors` is provided (#2896 review, Codex), a match whose
 * `comment.author` is missing or not a case-insensitive member of that
 * set is excluded from the candidate set **before** "newest" is
 * selected, not only from the eligible count: the contract states
 * "syntax alone never grants ownership" (see [Per-target
 * ownership](../../skills/issue-authoring/references/contract.md)), so
 * an untrusted-author body -- even a byte-exact canonical one -- is
 * never treated as a real marker for either purpose. An earlier
 * revision filtered trust only for eligibility, which let a trailing
 * untrusted-author match steal "newest" status from the legitimate
 * trusted marker just before it, wrongly reporting that trusted marker
 * as superseded backlog (round 2 of review, Codex: the fix for the
 * `minimize-superseded-markers.mts`/documented-sweep trust
 * requirement -- round 1 -- did not go far enough). `trustedActors` left
 * `undefined` disables this filter entirely (backward-compatible: every
 * byte-exact match counts as a candidate regardless of author, matching
 * pre-#2896-review behavior).
 *
 * A candidate match whose `isMinimized` is already `true` is excluded
 * from the eligible count -- it is not backlog, it is already handled
 * (this exclusion is unaffected by trust filtering: it applies to
 * whichever candidate set survives the trust filter above). Returns `0`
 * when `comments` is `undefined` (the caller, {@link
 * checkAuthoringMarkerMinimizationBacklog}, reports that family as "not
 * checked" rather than treating this `0` as a confirmed zero) or when
 * fewer than two (trust-filtered, when applicable) candidates exist
 * (nothing can be "superseded" without a later candidate to supersede
 * it).
 *
 * Delegates the actual classification to {@link classifyAuthoringMarkerFamily}
 * (`marker-helpers.mts`, extracted in #2935 alongside `sweep-authoring-
 * markers.mts`'s fetch-driven sweep, which needs the same newest-per-
 * family/trust/already-minimized rule but returns the eligible comments
 * themselves, not just a count) -- kept as a thin count-only wrapper here
 * so this module's public surface and every existing caller are
 * unaffected.

 * strict fail here would block an unrelated publish on backlog this
 * session did not create. Not applicable (as a whole) when the caller

 *
 * **Per-family "not checked" vs "checked, zero found" (#2896 review).**
 * `comments` and `journalComments` are independently optional: a caller
 * may supply only one. The `detail` text always names both families and
 * distinguishes an omitted family ("not checked") from one that was
 * supplied and found to have zero backlog ("0") -- collapsing the two
 * into a bare `0` would misreport "never actually counted" as "counted,
 * found none", which is exactly the kind of silent gap this check exists
 * to surface. `total` (and therefore whether this finding carries
 * `severity: 'warning'`) sums only the families actually checked; an
 * omitted family never contributes a phantom `0` to that sum.

// is still open right before the blank line" -- without re-running the
// full ancestry-stack simulation just to find out.
//
// That structural fact is not the same as the list still being open in
// the Markdown a human reader sees, though (found on this PR's own
// review, Codex): a marker followed by unindented plain prose --
// `- Before merging\n  - child\nIndependent prose` -- reads as the list
// having ended before the blank line, even though the algorithm's stack
// still shows a node open (the trailing prose is a continuation line
// attached via the ancestry walk, not a marker, so nothing closes it).
// CommonMark's own lazy-continuation rule technically disagrees --
// "Independent prose" is absorbed into "child"'s own paragraph rather
// than ending the list -- but that is a well-known surprising edge case
// that misleads readers (this PR's own Codex review included) far more
// often than it helps them, so this heuristic follows the visual
// reading over the stricter spec rule. Bridging across the blank line
// in that shape would scope "Before" onto a reference in the next chunk
// that a human author would not expect it to reach. Rather than trying
// to fully re-derive CommonMark's real list-termination semantics,
// require the last marker line to *be* the run's last line -- any
// trailing continuation line makes "is this list still open" ambiguous
// enough that refusing to bridge (a missed advisory, not a false one)
// is the safer default, matching the same
// prefer-a-miss-over-a-false-positive stance the indentation guard below

 * behavior for plain prose.
 *
 * Tracks a full indentation-ancestry stack of open `ListItemNode`s rather
 * than a single most-recently-seen marker indentation (see issue #1474):
 * a marker line strictly *deeper* than the stack's top is pushed as a new
 * child node, nested under it. A marker at the *same or shallower*
 * indentation pops nodes off the stack — closing each one — until the top
 * is strictly shallower (or the stack empties), then pushes the new
 * marker as a fresh node at that level.
 *
 * Closing a node emits it as its own block *only when it never acquired a
 * child* (a leaf): the block is that leaf's still-open ancestors' own
 * lines (root through parent, in document order) followed by the leaf's
 * own lines. A node that did acquire a child is never emitted standalone
 * — its own lines already appear as the ancestor prefix of every one of
 * its descendant leaf blocks, so nothing is lost. Net effect: every
 * root-to-leaf path down the tree emits exactly one block containing
 * every node on that path, and every node lies on at least one such path.
 * That scopes a parent bullet's coordination language together with
 * *every* nested child's reference at any depth — not only the first
 * child under a given parent, fixing the residual gap #1472 left behind
 * — while same-depth sibling bullets never share a leaf block with each
 * other, preserving the original tight-list sentence-conflation fix this
 * function exists for.
 *
 * Lines seen before any node has opened (a plain-prose preamble, or an
 * entire paragraph with no markers at all) accumulate in a separate
 * `preamble` buffer rather than the stack — there is no ancestor above
 * pre-first-marker prose to scope it with. `preamble` is flushed as its
 * own standalone block as soon as the first marker line opens a node
 * (preserving the existing behavior that leading prose never merges with
 * the first list item), or as the paragraph's sole block if no marker
 * ever appears.
 *
 * Two further gaps in the same area, both distinct from the
 * marker-ancestry scoping above, were closed by #1476: a continuation
 * line resuming at an ancestor's own indentation after a deeper child
 * has already opened is now attributed to that ancestor rather than the
 * deepest open child (see the ancestry walk in the continuation-line
 * branch below, using `lineIndentColumn`), and a loose list — sibling
 * items separated by a blank line — no longer resets scope at the
 * paragraph boundary, because its caller (`checkProseOnlyDependency`)
 * now bridges a single blank line between two loose-list chunks via
 * `splitIntoParagraphs` before this function ever runs.

Mechanically audits a drafted GitHub issue body against the issue-authoring
contract's structural expectations (skills/issue-authoring/references/
contract.md): the autopilot-suitability marker, its cross-field
status:blocked-by-human agreement, markerPrefix consistency, required
section headings for the declared shape, the roadmap-id/blocked-by
dependency-marker rules, visible/hidden suitability+effort line
agreement, and an advisory (warning-severity only) check that flags an
issue/PR reference used near coordination language with no corresponding
dependency marker, (when --comments-file is supplied) the
authoring-owner-marker-trail check that verifies an authoring-labeled
issue carries the owner-marker/publication-token trail, and (when
--comments-file and/or --journal-comments-file is supplied) the
authoring-marker-minimization-backlog check that counts eligible,
not-yet-minimized superseded authoring-owner / authoring-publication-intent
marker comments. Exits 0 when every check passes, 1 when any check fails,
2 on a usage error; the advisory check and
authoring-marker-minimization-backlog never affect the exit code.
