// Clone-scoped mutual-exclusion lock (#2223): serializes `git worktree
// add`, `git worktree remove`, and `git fetch` against the shared primary
// clone when multiple concurrent sessions operate against it. This is a
// different kind of lock than `claim-lock.mts`: that one records
// worktree-local *ownership* for a whole worker's lifetime and reports a
// same-machine collision immediately (never blocks). This one is a
// short-duration *mutex* around a single git operation -- it blocks
// (retrying with backoff) until it can acquire, up to a bounded timeout,
// because the operations it guards are expected to finish in seconds, not
// the hours a claim can be held for.
//
// The lock file lives in the primary clone's *shared* git-admin directory
// (`git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`), not any one
// worktree's private admin dir -- every worktree of the same clone shares
// this path, which is exactly the scope a clone-wide mutex needs. A
// linked worktree's own `.git` is a file, not this shared directory, so
// resolving through `--git-common-dir` (rather than `--absolute-git-dir`,
// which `claim-lock.mts` uses for its narrower per-worktree scope) is
// required here.
//
// This module deliberately has NO automatic stale-lock recovery. A
// holder that crashes leaves an orphaned lock file behind -- unlike a
// real `flock(2)`, a plain lock file is not released automatically when
// its owning process dies -- and a timed-out waiter is simply told so,
// with the lock path and the recorded holder's `pid` in the error
// message, and pointed at a manual `rm <lock-path>` once a human has
// confirmed the holder is actually gone (the same approach git's own
// `index.lock` takes on a stale-lock collision). This module went
// through three different automatic-recovery designs across successive
// review rounds on #2223 -- an mtime-elapsed-time threshold with a
// periodic lease refresh, then a PID-tagged arbiter lock with
// inode-verified recovery, then a simplified PID-liveness check with no
// arbiter -- and every one of them was found to have a genuine
// concurrency defect by the next review round: a live, actively
// -refreshing holder taken over anyway under scheduling jitter; a
// wrapper process's own pid going "dead" while the git child it spawned
// was still running and still needed the lock; more than one waiter
// racing to reclaim the exact same confirmed-dead entry. Every
// mitigation attempted for one of these introduced a new gap of its own
// rather than eliminating the underlying problem, because implementing
// a genuinely race-free "is this specific holder now provably gone, and
// can exactly one waiter reclaim it" protocol needs a coordination
// primitive (a kernel-level compare-and-swap, or a real `flock(2)`)
// plain POSIX file read/write/rename operations do not provide. Rather
// than continue layering fixes onto that fundamentally unsound
// foundation, automatic recovery was removed entirely: the only
// remaining decision authority for who acquires this lock is the OS
// kernel's own `O_EXCL` guarantee on a single `{ flag: 'wx' }` create,
// which is unconditionally race-free by construction -- there is no
// removal, no recreation, and no second coordination primitive left for
// a defect to hide in. `idd-skill#2223`'s Acceptance Criteria only ever
// required an acquire/release interface and serializing two concurrent
// invocations against each other, never automatic stale-lock recovery.
// The lock body still records the holder's own `pid` (`isPidAlive`,
// `process.kill(pid, 0)`), but purely as diagnostic information for a
// human deciding whether it is safe to remove the lock by hand -- never
// as input to an automated takeover decision. This is a purely local
// mutex scoped to operations that normally complete in seconds -- it
// carries none of `claim-lock.mts`'s GitHub-reverification requirement,
// because this lock has no cross-machine claim-ownership meaning to
// protect.
