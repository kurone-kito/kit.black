  Every flag except --apply is forwarded verbatim to the read-only
  pre-merge-readiness collector, so the full collector flag surface is
  accepted here — including --idd-agent-logins, --now, and the deprecated
  --expected-claim-id / --expected-agent-id aliases. --owner and --repo
  must be passed together or not at all.

  Default (no --apply): dry-run. Evaluates every F3 merge gate via the
  read-only pre-merge-readiness collector and prints { ready, blockers,
  mergeCommand } without merging. Exit 0 when ready, 1 otherwise.

  --apply: when ready, re-fetch the head SHA and re-validate the claim
  immediately before merging, then run a merge commit bound to the
  validated head. Fails closed (exit 1, no merge) on head drift or lost
  claim. Never squash/rebase merges. The merge is the only mutation.

  #1521 solo-CODEOWNER --admin fallback: if the plain merge command fails
  with GitHub's "base branch policy prohibits the merge" error, and the
  repository has not set mergeGate.soloCodeownerAdminFallback to
  "hold-and-report" in .github/idd/config.json, this retries ONCE with
  --admin -- but ONLY when reviewerStates.codeownerSelfApproval proves the
  PR author is the sole eligible codeowner (status "clear", a bypass-actor
  reason, and prAuthorIsSoleEligibleCodeowner true). A genuinely
  outstanding review from any other codeowner never triggers this retry.
  The retry also requires a second immediate head/claim/readiness
  re-validation and a live MERGEABLE state; a BEHIND state is accepted only
  when the fresh branch-currency evidence says an up-to-date head is not
  required. Unreadable or unsafe live state aborts the retry.
  The verdict's adminFallbackUsed field records whether this path fired.

  Local-head-drift warning (#2453): when the invoking worktree's local
  git branch matches this PR's own branch but its local HEAD differs from
  the head about to merge, the verdict's localHeadDrift field is set and
  a warning is printed on stderr -- a non-fatal signal an unpushed commit
  may be about to be left behind. Never blocks the merge; a silent no-op
  from any other directory, branch, or local read failure.
