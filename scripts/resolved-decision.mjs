 * Single-sourced detector for a "resolved maintainer decision" signal in an

 * text>`.
 *
 * `suitability-triage.mts`'s Check 7 (Verifiability) originated this
 * detection for #2661/#2711 across many independent review rounds (cited
 * inline below); `discover-viability-gate.mts`'s `autonomous_completion`
 * criterion (#2763) reuses it verbatim to exclude the SAME resolved-decision
 * line from its own `EXTERNAL_COORDINATION_PATTERN` scan, rather than
 * maintaining a second, independently-drifting regex for the same shape --
 * `docs/idd-workflow.md`'s Groom section tells an operator to write exactly
 * this line, so an issue groomed as documented must not then fail the A4
 * gate that runs before Check 7 ever sees it.

// `` `<!--` `` followed by a later bullet naming the real artifact.
// `ignoredOpenerRanges` (optional, defaults to none so existing callers

// applies immediately after the colon, so a placeholder resolution is not
// mistaken for a real one -- both the heading form's own negated-"resolved"
// phrasing ("not yet decided") and this inline form's own still-pending
// vocabulary (TBD, pending, undecided, deferred, "still open"), since the
// inline form has no positive `\bresolved\b` requirement to fall back on
// (#2661 C1 review). The leading `[\s*_\`>-]*` skips past Markdown emphasis
// (`**pending**`, `_TBD_`, `` `still open` ``) and list/blockquote markers
// ("- TBD ...", "> pending ...") that would otherwise land between the colon
// and the denylist word (Codex + Copilot review, PR #2662); the trailing
// `(?![a-zA-Z])` replaces a plain `\b`, which fails to end the match after
// "TBD_" (both `D` and `_` are `\w`, so `\b` finds no boundary there) even
// though the underscore is just a closing emphasis marker, not part of the
// word. The negated-decision-noun class (`no\s+(?:decision|consensus|
// agreement|resolution|verdict|ruling|conclusion)(?:\s+yet)?`) and the
// still-open-state class (`(?:still|remains?)\s+(?:open|undecided|
// unresolved|pending|unsettled)`) replace the earlier single-phrase
// entries ("no decision yet", "still open") with their semantic families,
// covering "no consensus yet" and similar noun-first phrasings the
// verb-first "not (yet) decided" denylist entries don't match (Codex
// rounds 2-3, PR #2662) without enumerating every synonym as its own
// literal. Deliberately NOT a bare `no\s+\w+`: "no changes to the API;
// keep as-is" is a genuinely resolved decision, not a pending one.
// **Convergence boundary**: this denylist is already stricter than
// precedent -- `RESOLVED_DECISION_PATTERN` above has carried no
// resolution-text denylist at all since #1135, and its own docstring
// accepts exactly this soft-heuristic trade-off. A denylist can never
// enumerate every future synonym; widen a *class* here only for a
// concrete reported case, not for a hypothetical one. Resolution text must
// start on the SAME LINE as the colon (`[ \t]*`, no newline tolerance): an
// earlier revision allowed a single hard-wrapped line break here, which
// fixed the immediate "colon immediately followed by a blank line" case
// (Codex round 2, PR #2662) but still let an empty marker consume the very
// next line's first character even with no blank line at all -- e.g. a
// heading's "#" right after "Maintainer decision (...):\n" (Copilot round
// 6, PR #2662). Dropping the newline tolerance entirely closes both cases
// at once; neither of this fix's two real-world citations (#2644, #2641)
// ever needed it, since GitHub's hard-wrap only splits the provenance
// parenthetical, never the colon-to-resolution boundary itself. The
// lookahead right after the opening "("
// requires the parenthetical to actually contain one of the three
// provenance signals this shape is documented to carry -- an issue/PR
// reference, "Groom hearing", or an ISO-style date -- rather than accepting
// any (or empty) parenthetical content as if provenance were merely
// decorative (Copilot review round 2, PR #2662): without this, "Maintainer
// decision (): ..." or "Maintainer decision (just kidding): ..." could
// bypass the subjective-approval gate with no real grooming-pass record
// behind it. `pending`/`undecided`/`deferred` additionally require a clause
// boundary (through optional "yet"/"still"/"for now" and Markdown
// decoration) immediately after the word -- these three, unlike TBD/TBA/TBC,
// are ordinary English adjectives that can open a genuinely settled
// resolution's own sentence ("deferred to follow-up issue #100 so this
// patch remains scoped", "pending requests will be rejected with HTTP
// 409"); only a bare, sentence-ending use of the word signals a real
// placeholder (Codex round 4, PR #2662). This is the same soft
// co-occurrence heuristic as the heading form: it does not verify the
