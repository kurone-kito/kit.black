overlap an actively-claimed or open-PR issue. recommendedOrder applies the soft

discover.selectionDesync — the agent layers the overlap nudge after its own
desync pick. Evidence-only: never a hard gate.

Without --check-overlap no active-set discovery runs (no extra GitHub API
cost); each candidate's high-contention files are still reported.

--check-overlap coverage (best-effort, no repo-wide comment scan): open-PR
overlap scans open PRs (bounded by the gh pr list page cap). Active-claim
overlap scans the issues that have a remote issue/<n>-* branch (every IDD claim
creates one once pushed), paginated to the end and resolved with the configured
claim stale age, so a non-stale claim held by another session is detected even
when it is outside the unclaimed candidate set being ranked. A claim whose
branch is not yet pushed is picked up once it appears remotely.
