// Read-only rerun-plan helper for stuck `idd-advisory-convergence` rollups
// (#1431). Automates the manual recovery documented in
// `idd-ci.instructions.md` §Rerun mechanics (#1381, extended by #1424): a
// PR HEAD can accumulate several `idd-advisory-convergence` check-run
// instances (the check fires on pull_request + pull_request_review +
// pull_request_review_comment, and `cancel-in-progress` cancels most of
// them), and the required-check rollup can stay pinned to a stale
// non-passing instance even after the real verdict converges. This helper
// fetches every check-run instance for the current HEAD via the commit
// check-runs API (not the recent-runs list, which can page the target run
// out of view -- see the module-level `fetchCheckRunsForRef` doc comment),
// classifies each instance, and prints the exact sequential `gh run rerun`
// recovery plan. It never calls `gh run rerun` (or any other mutating
// command) itself; a mutating `--apply` mode is a deliberate follow-up
// (out of scope here).
//
// Classification (six states -- the issue's three named buckets, `pass` /
// `rerun-eligible` / `bot-gated-skip`, are a subset here; `pending`,
// `unresolved`, and `awaiting-fresh-review` are additional fail-safe
// states so a live run is never force-classified into either "skip
// forever" or "safe to rerun", an unresolvable run identity is reported
// instead of silently guessed or dropped, and a failure whose own
// advisory-convergence verdict is "review does not cover HEAD" is never
// recommended for a rerun that cannot change that outcome -- #1775):
//   - `pass`: conclusion is success/neutral/skipped -- no action needed.
//   - `pending`: still queued/in_progress (no conclusion yet) -- reported,
//     excluded from the plan (rerunning a live run cancels it, not helps).
//   - `bot-gated-skip`: conclusion is `action_required` -- rerunning
//     without a non-bot trigger or maintainer approval re-enters
//     `action_required` per #1424, so this needs a non-bot trigger or
//     maintainer approval, never a rerun. Whether the underlying workflow
//     run's actor/triggering_actor is a bot (`type === "Bot"` is the
//     primary signal; a configured advisory-bot login is a defensive
//     fallback) is reported in the reason text when it applies, but no
//     longer gates BY ITSELF (narrowed by #1745): #1424 only established
//     that an `action_required`-conclusion Copilot-triggered run is gated
//     by GitHub, never that every bot-triggered instance regardless of its
//     own conclusion is unsafe to rerun. A direct experiment on PR #1741
//     confirmed a `CANCELLED`-conclusion bot-triggered instance reran and
//     completed normally, never re-entering `action_required` -- the prior,
//     over-broad `|| botTriggered` condition withheld exactly that working
//     recovery action from the plan.
//   - `unresolved`: the run id could not be parsed from the check-run's
//     URL, or the per-run lookup itself failed -- reported for manual
//     inspection, never silently dropped and never placed in the plan
//     (fail-closed: an instance this helper cannot positively verify as
//     safe is never recommended for rerun).
//   - `awaiting-fresh-review`: the instance's own advisory-convergence
//     JSON verdict (from the workflow job log) reports that the latest
//     Copilot review does not cover the current HEAD. No number of
//     `gh run rerun` invocations changes that outcome -- only a fresh
//     review does -- so this is never placed in the plan and never
//     spends the rerun-once budget (#1775, observed on PR #1772).
//     #1806: this historical verdict is a snapshot of the workflow job
//     log at the time THAT run executed, and the log is immutable -- so
//     an instance that failed BEFORE a fresh review landed keeps
//     reporting uncovered-HEAD forever, even once live coverage is
//     satisfied (observed on PR #1854: the failed run's own log still
//     said "does not cover current HEAD" after Copilot had already
//     reviewed the real current HEAD with no new comments). When a LIVE
//     check (reusing `advisory-convergence.mts`'s own Clause 1 evidence
//     via `review-clause.mts`) confirms the current HEAD IS now covered,
//     this classification recovers to `rerun-eligible` instead of
//     staying stuck -- see `RerunPlanOptions.headCoverageSatisfied` and
//     `classifyInstance`'s uncovered-HEAD step. Live coverage that is
//     unreadable, not yet established, or simply not checked (no
//     historical uncovered-HEAD reason to recover) leaves this hold
//     exactly as it was before #1806 -- fail-closed, never an invented
//     rerun.
//   - `rerun-eligible`: non-pass, terminal, resolved -- goes into the
//     ordered rerun plan (bot-triggered or not, unless gated per above).
//
// Reuse map (no duplicated identity/config logic):
//   - `resolveAdvisoryPrimaryBotLogin`, `isCopilotReviewerLogin`,
//     `resolveAdvisoryBotLogins`, `advisoryBotIdentityToken` -- the same
//     bot-identity configuration and matching (including the `[bot]`-suffix
//     normalization) every advisory-wait/-convergence helper already uses.
//   - `normalizeCiWaitPolicy` -- the same ciWait.rerunPolicy resolution
//     `idd-ci.instructions.md` §Rerun mechanics makes this helper's own
//     recovery recommendations subject to.
//   - `resolveCiRerunDecision` -- the same rerun-once-budget decision
//     (policy string AND per-run rerun-attempt count) CI-wait itself
//     applies, reused per instance here (via each instance's own
//     `runAttempt`) rather than re-derived, so this helper can never
//     recommend a rerun CI-wait's own budget would already refuse
//     (ci-wait-policy.mts).
//   - `deriveGhHttpStatus` -- discriminates a confirmed 404 (genuinely no
//     remote config) from any other unreadable state, so a cross-repo
//     config fetch fails closed instead of guessing (gh-http-status.mts).
//   - `ghText` -- shared `gh` execution (gh-exec.mts). The CLI-entry-point
//     guard below uses Node's own native `import.meta.main`, which
//     replaced this repo's hand-rolled `isCliExecution` helper (removed
//     from gh-exec.mts by an unrelated `main`-sync merge).
//   - `parsePaginatedGhNdjson` -- shared NDJSON pagination parser
//     (protocol-helpers.mts), reused directly here rather than through
//     `ghApiJson`'s `paginate` mode: that mode hardcodes `--jq '.[]'` for a
//     bare top-level array, but the commit check-runs endpoint's shape is
//     `{ total_count, check_runs: [...] }`, so this file's own
//     `fetchCheckRunsForRef` passes `--jq '.check_runs[]'` instead.
//   - `resolveLatestCopilotReviewClause`, `fetchReviewsAndHeadCommit`
//     (review-clause.mts, #1806) -- the SAME latest-review Clause 1
//     evidence `advisory-convergence.mts`'s own `converged` verdict is
//     built on, reused here for the live-coverage recovery signal
//     (`RerunPlanOptions.headCoverageSatisfied`) instead of a second,
//     independent GraphQL path that could drift out of sync with the
//     real gate's own notion of "covers current HEAD". Deliberately
//     imported from the small `review-clause.mts` module rather than
//     `advisory-convergence.mts` directly, keeping this read-only
//     helper's dependency surface off that file's full claim/waiver/
//     disposition machinery (see `review-clause.mts`'s own doc comment).
//
// This helper never mutates GitHub state: it only reads check-run/run data
// and prints a diagnosis plus a plan of commands for a human (or a future
// --apply follow-up) to execute.

  //    recommend rerunning a DIFFERENT, already-passing instance instead --
  //    circumventing the "one rerun, then a human reviews it" boundary the
  //    budget hold exists to enforce.
  // 2. `everyReRunningEligibleIsBotTriggered` (#1745 Codex review, this
  //    PR): pre-#1745, EVERY bot-triggered non-pass instance was
  //    `bot-gated-skip`, so `eligibleInstances.length === 0` alone
  //    correctly meant "bot-gated-only, nothing else to trigger a fresh
  //    evaluation" -- the scenario recoveryRefreshPlan's own doc comment
  //    describes. #1745 narrowed `bot-gated-skip` to a genuine
  //    `action_required` conclusion only, so a bot-triggered `CANCELLED`
  //    sibling can now be BOTH independently `rerun-eligible` (goes into
  //    `plan`) AND coexist with a still-genuinely-gated `action_required`
  //    instance that ALSO needs the passing-instance refresh -- rerunning
  //    the bot-triggered eligible instance does not itself supply the
  //    "fresh NON-BOT-triggered evaluation" the refresh mechanism exists
  //    to force (a rerun preserves its original run's triggering actor),
  //    so it must not suppress recoveryRefreshPlan the way a genuinely
  //    NON-bot rerun-eligible instance legitimately does (that instance's
  //    own rerun already IS the needed non-bot trigger). Vacuously `true`
  //    when there is nothing in `plan` to begin with, preserving the
  //    original bot-gated-only case unchanged.
  //
  // #1806 interaction (intentional): a live-coverage-recovered instance
  // (classified `rerun-eligible` instead of `awaiting-fresh-review` --
  // see `classifyInstance`'s uncovered-HEAD step) enters `eligibleInstances`
  // like any other rerun-eligible instance. If ITS OWN `runAttempt` already
  // exhausted the rerun-once budget, rule 1 above applies to it exactly the
  // same way it already applies to any other budget-held eligible instance:
  // `anyEligibleHeld` becomes `true` and `recoveryRefreshPlan` is withheld
  // for the WHOLE rollup, even when a separate, still-genuinely-stuck
  // `bot-gated-skip` sibling exists. This is not a #1806-specific carve-out
  // -- #1806 only widens which instances CAN reach `eligibleInstances` in
  // the first place; rule 1's own boundary (a human must look at a
  // budget-exhausted eligible instance rather than have the tool silently

By default (without --apply): read-only. Fetches every
"${RERUN_PLAN_CHECK_NAME}" check-run instance for the PR's current HEAD SHA
(commit check-runs API, paged -- not the recent-runs list, which can page
the target run out of view), classifies each as pass / pending /
bot-gated-skip / unresolved / awaiting-fresh-review / rerun-eligible, and
prints the ordered sequential "gh run rerun <id>" recovery plan for the
rerun-eligible instances (each command includes "-R <owner>/<repo>" when
the repository is known, so the plan is safe to run outside this
checkout). An instance whose own advisory-convergence verdict reports
that the latest review does not cover the current HEAD is classified
awaiting-fresh-review (not rerun-eligible) so the diagnosis tells the
operator to wait for a fresh review rather than burning the rerun-once
budget (#1775). Never calls "gh run rerun" (or any other mutating
command) itself.

With --apply: after printing the same diagnostic plan as above, executes
it -- "gh run rerun"-ing each rerun-eligible (never bot-gated-skip,
awaiting-fresh-review, or rerun-budget-held) instance one at a time,
waiting for each to reach a terminal state before starting the next,
exactly as "planCaveat" already documents. Prefers the recovery-refresh
plan first when one exists, matching idd-ci.instructions.md's documented
recovery order. After each rerun, the plan is recomputed from fresh
evidence and the loop stops early as soon as it resolves (no
rerun-eligible or recovery-refresh instance remains) instead of running
the rest of the original plan. A final summary of what ran and whether
the target state resolved is printed to stderr.

--owner and --repo must be given together (to inspect a PR outside the
current checkout) or omitted together (to auto-detect the current
checkout's own repository) -- providing only one is rejected.

Honors the inspected repository's configured ciWait.rerunPolicy: when
it is "hold", both the rerun plan and the recovery-refresh plan stay
empty (with a notice explaining why) instead of recommending reruns a
repository has deliberately opted out of -- --apply then has nothing
eligible to execute either.

On a normal (non-help) run, stdout carries ONLY the JSON plan document
(safe to pipe into "jq" or similar); the human-readable recovery-plan
summary (and, under --apply, the final apply summary) is printed to
stderr. (This --help text itself is the one exception: it is plain usage
text on stdout, not JSON.)
