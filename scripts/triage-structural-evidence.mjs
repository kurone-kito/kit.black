/**
 * Structural (non-lexical) evidence signal for the A4 viability gate and
 * the A4.5 suitability triage (#2767): three mechanical booleans an issue
 * body/author/edit-history can satisfy that, together, demote a specific
 * lexical false-positive `fail` to a `warn`-annotated `pass` instead of
 * outright rejecting a genuinely well-specified, trustworthy issue. Each
 * signal alone proves nothing about intent -- `verificationCommand` and
 * `candidateFilesExist` are shape checks any author (including an
 * untrusted one) can satisfy -- so the demotion always requires all
 * three together; `trustedEditor` is what actually carries the weight.
 *
 * Deliberately provider-agnostic: every function here takes already-
 * fetched primitives (body text, author login, editor logins, a trust
 * predicate) rather than fetching anything itself, so no test needs to
 * mock `gh` (per #1212's scope note) and no caller here needs to adopt
 * the provider-port abstraction. `discover-viability-gate.mts` and
 * `discover-orphan-filter.mts` (already provider-port callers) and
 * `suitability-triage.mts` (still on direct `gh` calls) each gather the
 * primitives their own way and call `evaluateStructuralEvidence`.

 * line breaks), never real checkboxes -- `gh api /markdown` confirms
 * this. A checkbox line counts when any of:
 *
 * - the immediately preceding line is blank (a fresh list can always

 * - the immediately preceding line *itself* genuinely opened or
 *   continued a real list (not merely LOOKED list-item-shaped -- round
 *   17's own bug, caught in round 19: `prose\n2. ordinary\n3. [ ] one`
 *   let the non-interrupting `2. ordinary` line's mere shape mark the
 *   following `3. [ ] one` as "continuing a list" and wrongly count it,
 *   even though `2. ordinary` itself never opened anything -- CommonMark
 *   keeps the whole run inside the original paragraph, `gh api
 *   /markdown` confirms zero real checkboxes here);
 * - its own marker is a bullet (`-`/`*`/`+`) or an ordered marker
 *   starting at `1` (`1.`/`1)`) -- CommonMark lets both interrupt a
 *   paragraph;
 * - it is `sectionText`'s own first line -- nothing precedes it inside
 *   the section to interrupt (the heading itself is a block boundary).
 *
 * The fix tracks one recursive per-line state -- "did THIS line actually
 * open or continue a real list" -- rather than round 17's shape-only
 * flag, so a non-interrupting list-shaped line correctly fails to seed a
 * continuation for the line after it. Mirrors
 * `findIndentedCodeRanges`'s own `isNonInterruptingListItem` logic (built
 * for a different purpose -- container/list-content-indent tracking this
 * simpler per-line walk does not need).
 *
 * A non-list-item-shaped line does not always end the list either. An
 * indented explanation between two ordered items -- `1. [ ] first\n
 * an indented explanation\n2. [ ] second` -- is CommonMark's own
 * multi-line list-item content, absorbed into item 1, with the list
 * still open for item 2 right after it (Codex review, PR #2840, round
 * 21; `gh api /markdown` confirms both render as real checkboxes). Nor
 * does the continuation line need any indentation at all (Codex review,
 * PR #2840, round 24): CommonMark's own lazy-continuation rule lets a
 * paragraph (list-item content included) continue on a following
 * non-blank line regardless of that line's own indentation, e.g. `1. [ ]
 * first\nlazy continuation\n2. [ ] second` still renders both as real
 * checkboxes. A non-list-shaped line therefore keeps the list open
 * whenever the list was already open, with no indentation test at all --
 * only a blank line, a blockquote-start line, or a thematic-break line
 * (all three handled next) ends it.
 *
 * A blockquote marker or a thematic break also frees the *next* line to
 * open a brand-new list with any marker shape, exactly like a blank line
 * (Codex review, PR #2840, round 25, databaseId 3976526317): both
 * constructs interrupt an open paragraph/list unconditionally per
 * CommonMark 5.1/4.1, so `---\n2. [ ] first\n3. [ ] second` and
 * `prose\n> quoted\n2. [ ] first\n3. [ ] second` both render every
 * checkbox as real -- confirmed via `gh api /markdown` -- yet the
 * previous version left `previousLineOpensOrContinuesList` (and the
 * implicit "is a paragraph open" state) stuck at whatever it was
 * *before* the interrupting line, wrongly undercounting both. A
 * thematic break is a self-contained leaf block (never absorbs a
 * following line), so the very next line starts fresh either way. A
 * blockquote is a container, though: an unprefixed line right after it
 * (no blank line in between) is CommonMark's own lazy continuation of
 * the blockquote's *own* inner paragraph, not a new top-level paragraph
 * -- `1. [ ] first\n> quoted block\nplain paragraph\n2. [ ] second`
 * (the literal round-25 finding text) still renders both checkboxes,
 * because "plain paragraph" is absorbed into the blockquote, leaving no
 * open top-level paragraph for "2." to interrupt. A dedicated
 * `insideOpenBlockquote` flag tracks exactly that: it starts (and stays)
 * true across every such absorbed, non-blank, non-block-starting line,
 * and is cleared the moment a blank line, a fresh interrupting
 * construct, or a line that itself successfully opens/continues a list
 * appears -- `gh api /markdown` confirms that inserting a genuine blank
 * line before "plain paragraph" instead makes it a real top-level
 * paragraph that blocks the following non-`1` marker, and this function
 * matches that too.
 *
 * A blockquote-prefixed line can ALSO carry its own list-item marker on
 * the same line -- `> - [ ] first\n> - [ ] second` (Codex review, PR
 * #2840, round 26, databaseId 3976819201) -- and GFM renders task lists
 * nested inside a blockquote exactly like a top-level one, confirmed via
 * `gh api /markdown`. A second, independent state pair
 * (`quotedNoOpenParagraph` / `quotedListOpen`) tracks list-continuation
 * for that quoted content, reset fresh whenever a blockquote region
 * starts (mirroring the top-level state at the section's own start) and
 * left untouched across a lazily-absorbed unprefixed line in between --
 * `> - [ ] first\nnot quoted\n> - [ ] second` still renders both
 * checkboxes as real (the unprefixed line lazily continues item 1's own
 * content, per the same blockquote-laziness rule above), confirmed via
 * `gh api /markdown`. Deliberately scoped to one level of quoting only
 * (a nested blockquote or thematic break inside the quoted content is
 * out of scope for this line-based scanner, same as the top-level walk
 * never models deeper container nesting either).

/**
 * Section boundary: an ATX heading, or the position immediately before a

 * followed, with no blank line between, by a lone run of `=`/`-`
 * characters). Duplicated from `suitability-triage.mts`'s own
 * `NEXT_HEADING_PATTERN` rather than imported -- that file imports this
 * module for the demotion wiring, so sharing the constant would create a
 * circular import. (Codex review, PR #2840): an ATX-only boundary let a
 * Setext-style sibling section's own content leak into the extracted
 * `## Acceptance criteria` text, so a command or 2+ checkboxes in that
 * later, unrelated section could set `verificationCommand: true` on a
 * trusted issue and wrongly demote a genuine autonomy/verifiability
 * failure -- not merely fail to find the boundary, the false-positive
 * direction this module exists to avoid.
 *
 * Two further fixes (Copilot review, PR #2840, round 8) -- both
 * false-negative directions (truncating a section's own real content
 * too early), the opposite of the false-positive direction above, but
 * still a genuine functional bug (this file's own `parseCandidateFiles`
 * sibling boundary had the identical Setext/thematic-break confusion,
 * fixed there in an earlier round of this same PR):
 *
 * - A negative lookahead excludes a list-item bullet, ordered-list
 *   marker, or blockquote line from ever being read as Setext-heading
 *   content: `- [ ] one\n---\n` is CommonMark's own thematic break
 *   ending the list, never a Setext heading over that bullet, so
 *   without the exclusion a genuine trailing checklist item followed by
 *   a thematic break wrongly ended the `## Acceptance criteria` section
 *   before its own real content.
 * - `\r?\n` (not bare `\n`) before and after the underline line: this
 *   pattern carries no `/m` flag, so `(?:\n|$)` never matched a
 *   CRLF-terminated underline line, silently missing the Setext
 *   boundary on a Windows-style-line-ending issue body (GitHub accepts
 *   either) and leaking a later section's content the same way an
 *   entirely-missed ATX boundary would have.
 *
 * A third fix (Codex review, PR #2840, round 15, corrected round 16): an
 * indented continuation line of a list item (e.g. `- Run:` followed by a
 * two-space-indented `` `node --test ...` `` line) is not a
 * candidate-files-boundary-eligible top-level Setext heading content line
 * even though it starts with neither a marker nor `>` -- it belongs to
 * the enclosing list item, a different container level, and a dedented
 * `---` right after it is CommonMark's own thematic break, not a Setext
 * underline over that indented line. `gh api /markdown` confirms this
 * renders as a real list-item continuation plus a real `<hr>`, not a
 * heading.
 *
 * Round 15 fixed this by requiring the content line to carry zero leading
 * indentation, mirroring `discover-shared-file-overlap.mts`'s own blanket
 * "any indented line is Setext-ineligible" heuristic -- but a fresh
 * finding (round 16) showed that heuristic goes the *dangerous* direction
 * for this module's purpose: a genuine, CommonMark-legal 1-3-space-indented
 * Setext heading (e.g. `" Notes\n -----"` right after a blank line) was
 * then wrongly excluded too, letting the section read past it and pick up
 * an unrelated later section's own command/checkboxes as if they were the
 * Acceptance-criteria section's own. `gh api /markdown` confirms that
 * heading renders as real structure.
 *
 * The precise rule (matching `discover-shared-file-overlap.mts`'s own
 * `isSetextIneligiblePrecedingLine` line-array helper, translated to a
 * lookbehind since this function works on `rest.search()` over a single
 * string rather than a `lines` array): an indented content line is only
 * Setext-ineligible when it is itself a *continuation* -- walking
 * backward from it through zero or more indented, non-blank lines
 * eventually reaches a marker/blockquote-led line. The lookbehind
 * expresses this as one marker-led line followed by a `*`-repeated group
 * of fully-consumed indented continuation lines (V8 supports a quantifier
 * inside a lookbehind); a continuation-of-a-continuation
 * (`- Run:\n  one\n  two\n---`) is excluded via that repeated group, not
 * just a direct one-line continuation. ` {0,3}` (space-only, bounded)
 * restores CommonMark's own real indent tolerance for the content line
 * itself, replacing round 15's zero-indent requirement.
 *
 * A fifth fix (Codex review, PR #2840, round 22): round 20 documented a
 * "residual" claiming a genuine multi-line Setext heading's own extra
 * leaked line (recognized starting at its LAST content line, not its
 * first) was inert prose that could not itself satisfy
 * `verificationCommand` -- disproven by a concrete counter-example, e.g.
 * `` "`node --test fake.test.mjs`\nNotes\n---" ``: the FIRST line is a
 * genuine inline code span (`gh api /markdown` confirms it renders as
 * real `<code>` inside the sibling `<h2>`), so leaving it inside the
 * current section's extracted text set `verificationCommand: true` from
 * a command that belongs to a different, later section entirely -- the
 * dangerous direction this module exists to avoid, not a benign
 * imprecision. The content-line match is now a `+`-repeated run of
 * qualifying lines (each still excluded from being marker/blockquote-led,
 * matching the single-line check this replaces) rather than exactly one
 * line, so the match starts at the run's FIRST line whenever the whole
 * run -- of any length -- ends in a real underline; `{0,3}` is now
 * per-line inside the repeated group (not just before it), so each line
 * of a genuinely multi-line, indented heading still gets its own
 * CommonMark indent tolerance independently.

 * `findMarkdownCodeRanges`'s own `findInlineCodeRanges` already excludes

 * `findHtmlCommentRanges`'s escaped-`<!--` guard mirrors elsewhere in this
 * module. Computed on the masked body (not the original) so a span that
 * only *looks* real until an enclosing fence/comment/HTML block is masked
 * away is not wrongly counted as surviving.
 *
 * Considered and rejected (Codex review, PR #2840, round 9; verified
 * against GitHub's own renderer via `gh api /markdown`, `mode: gfm`, not
 * just reasoned about): masking genuine inline code spans too before
 * heading/section-boundary detection, to guard against a multi-line span
 * "smuggling" a fake `## Acceptance criteria` heading plus fake
 * checkboxes past detection. CommonMark parses block structure before
 * inline content, and an ATX heading line interrupts an already-open
 * paragraph -- so a `` `` `` opened on one line is closed as that line's
 * own one-line paragraph the moment a `## heading` line follows, and the
 * unclosed backtick run reverts to literal text; the heading, checkboxes,
 * and any code span past it render as real structure, not span content.
 * `findMarkdownCodeRanges` on such a body already reflects this (via
 * `findInlineCodeRanges`'s own `findMarkdownBlockBoundary` paragraph-
 * boundary handling) -- it never returns a range spanning the heading
 * line -- so there is no fake heading for a masking pass to hide: the
 * input this finding described cannot occur under real Markdown
 * rendering. Adding a masking pass anyway would not fix a live gap; it
 * would make heading/Setext-boundary detection newly depend on
 * `findMarkdownBlockBoundary` being correct for every construct (thematic
 * break, Setext underline, HTML block) it was never exercised against for
 * this purpose, trading a phantom risk for a real one.
