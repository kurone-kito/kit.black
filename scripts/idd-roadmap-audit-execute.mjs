  Default (no --apply): dry-run. Evaluates A1.5 roadmap completion via the
  read-only discover-roadmap-graph traversal and prints { ready, blockers,
  evidenceBody } without mutating. Exit 0 when ready, 1 otherwise. evidenceBody
  is the canonical "IDD roadmap completion audit" comment body (empty when the
  roadmap is not ready).

  --apply: when ready, re-validate the roadmap-audit claim and re-evaluate the
  roadmap graph immediately before mutating, then post the evidence comment,
  close the roadmap as completed, and release the claim. Fails closed (exit 1,
  no mutation) on any lost / stale / non-owned claim or any blocker. The claim
  is re-validated against the roadmap issue; --claim-issue, when provided, must
  equal --roadmap. The active claim must be a roadmap-audit-scoped claim
  (branch roadmap-audit/<roadmap>-<slug>) and match --claim-id (required under
  --apply) and, when given, --agent-id. --owner and --repo must be passed
  together or not at all.

  CLAIM REJECTION REASONS: a not-owned result's "reason" code is one of:
    match                 the claim is owned (not a rejection)
    missing-active-claim  no active claim is present on the roadmap issue
    claim-id-mismatch     the active claim's claim-id is not the expected one
    agent-id-mismatch     the active claim's agent-id is not the expected one
    claim-branch-mismatch the active claim's branch is not a roadmap-audit
                           coordination claim (roadmap-audit/<roadmap>-<slug>)
                           for THIS roadmap -- a normal execution claim on the
                           roadmap issue does not authorize closure
    claim-stale           the active claim is older than the configured stale
                           age and is takeover-eligible, so it cannot prove
                           ongoing ownership
  Each not-owned "result" message embeds both the code and this explanation,
  so a policy rejection (e.g. claim-branch-mismatch) is never misread as an
  unexplained fetch failure.

  VIEWER-LOGIN LOOKUP: the trusted-author check needs this run's own GitHub
  login (via "gh api user"). A genuinely FAILED lookup (network/auth error, or
  an unexpected blank response) is reported as { viewerLoginUnavailable: true }
  on the verdict, and any not-owned "result" message gets a trailing NOTE, so a
  failed lookup is never silently indistinguishable from a real not-owned
  claim. Absent (never explicitly false) whenever the lookup succeeded.

  SCOPE: this helper gates only the MECHANICAL completion preconditions (all
  descendants closed/complete; no open / unresolved / inaccessible / linked-PR
  / nested-roadmap / childless / cycle / human-gate blocker). It does NOT verify
  the roadmap's free-form success criteria or autonomy-gap items — the caller
  must confirm those separately before --apply, exactly as the merge gate
  trusts that review actually happened.
