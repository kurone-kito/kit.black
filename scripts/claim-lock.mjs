// Worktree-local lock file: a same-machine fast path that complements the
// cross-machine activation-nonce claim check (#1522). The lock never judges
// staleness itself -- GitHub claim state stays the sole authority. A
// different-claim-id lock is always a collision; only an explicit
// `--takeover`, issued after the caller independently re-verifies live
// GitHub claim state (`resume-claim-routing.mjs --fresh-claim-gate`), may
// override it. This deliberately excludes any local liveness signal (e.g.
// process PID): under this repository's execution model, the process
// invoking this CLI is a one-shot child that exits the moment the call
// returns, so a recorded PID would be a tombstone before any competing
// session could ever observe it as "alive" -- checking it would silently
// defeat the very collision this lock exists to catch. See `## Claim
// revalidation gate` in idd-overview-core.instructions.md for the full
// protocol this helper implements (#1523).
//
// Re-acquiring a matching claim-id is read-only (no write at all): a
// same-claim-id "reacquire" only needs to confirm nobody else took over,
// never to refresh anything on disk (`acquiredAt` is audit-only -- no code
// path here reads it back to make a decision). An earlier revision deleted
// and recreated the file on every reacquire, which opened a window where an
// unrelated, unauthorized different-claim-id session could slip through a
// fresh `wx` create as if nobody held the lock -- exactly the collision
// this lock exists to catch. Making reacquire read-only removes that window
// entirely on the common fast path. The only path that still writes over an
// existing lock is an authorized `--takeover`, and it replaces the file via
// a same-directory temp-write + `renameSync` rather than unlink-then-create.
// POSIX replaces an existing regular file atomically; Windows requires that
// regular file to be removed before the rename, so that platform-specific
// fallback necessarily leaves a brief gap. A malformed directory at the lock
// path is the other recovery exception: an authorized takeover removes that
// exact directory before installing the replacement.
//
// This lock intentionally does not try to perfectly serialize two
// concurrent authorized takeovers of the same worktree -- that is a much
// narrower race than the collision above, and the claim revalidation gate
// (re-reading the GitHub claim-id before every mutation, independent of this
// lock) is the real authority there: GitHub claim parsing is deterministic,
// so only one concurrent takeover's claim-id can actually be the active one,
// regardless of what this local lock file happens to contain.

--acquire is idempotent for a matching --claim-id: it re-acquires

round-trip -- this is the fast path used before every mutation. A different
--claim-id is always reported as a collision, regardless of how old the

--takeover only after independently re-verifying live GitHub claim state

\`claimable\` or \`stale-reclaimable\`) to override a collision; \`holder\`
in the JSON output reports the previous occupant on both a plain collision
and an authorized takeover.

--check is read-only: it reports the current lock state without creating,
mutating, or deleting anything. \`malformed: true\` means a lock file
exists but could not be parsed as a well-formed lock body.
