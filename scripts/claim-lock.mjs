// Worktree-local lock file: a same-machine fast path that complements the
// cross-machine activation-nonce claim check (#1522). The lock never judges
// staleness itself -- GitHub claim state stays the sole authority. A
// different-claim-id lock is always a collision; only an explicit
// `--takeover`, issued after the caller independently re-verifies live
// GitHub claim state (`resume-claim-routing.mjs --fresh-claim-gate`), may
// override it. This deliberately excludes any local liveness signal (e.g.
// process PID): under this repository's execution model, the process
// invoking this CLI is a one-shot child that exits the moment the call
// returns, so a recorded PID would be a tombstone before any competing
// session could ever observe it as "alive" -- checking it would silently
// defeat the very collision this lock exists to catch. See `## Claim
// revalidation gate` in idd-overview-core.instructions.md for the full
// protocol this helper implements (#1523).
//
// Re-acquiring a matching claim-id is read-only (no write at all): a
// same-claim-id "reacquire" only needs to confirm nobody else took over,
// never to refresh anything on disk (`acquiredAt` is audit-only -- no code
// path here reads it back to make a decision). An earlier revision deleted
// and recreated the file on every reacquire, which opened a window where an
// unrelated, unauthorized different-claim-id session could slip through a
// fresh `wx` create as if nobody held the lock -- exactly the collision
// this lock exists to catch. Making reacquire read-only removes that window
// entirely on the common fast path. The only path that still writes over an
// existing lock is an authorized `--takeover`, and it replaces the file via
// a same-directory temp-write + `renameSync` rather than unlink-then-create.
// POSIX replaces an existing regular file atomically; Windows requires that
// regular file to be removed before the rename, so that platform-specific
// fallback necessarily leaves a brief gap. A malformed directory at the lock
// path is the other recovery exception: an authorized takeover removes that
// exact directory before installing the replacement.
//
// Fresh-create atomicity (#2920): the very first `--acquire` against an
// absent lock also writes to the lock path, via `createLockFileExclusively`
// below -- a same-directory temp-write + `linkSync` (atomic, EEXIST-exclusive
// hard link), never a direct `writeFileSync(path, ..., { flag: 'wx' })`. A
// direct `wx` create leaves a window between the file becoming visible at
// `path` (open+create) and its content finishing (write) where a concurrent
// `readLock` can observe a torn/partial body and misclassify it as
// `malformed` -- producing a false `collision` result even when the same
// `claimId` is about to win the race. Writing the full body to a temp file
// first (fully written and closed before it is ever linked in) and then
// atomically hard-linking it into place closes that window structurally: a
// concurrent reader can only ever observe "absent" or a fully-formed body at
// `path`, never a partial one. `linkSync` is create-only (no replace
// semantics), so unlike the takeover path's `renameSync` fallback above, it
// needs no Windows-specific recovery branch -- `CreateHardLinkW` fails
// cleanly with `EEXIST` there too when the destination already exists.
//
// This lock intentionally does not try to perfectly serialize two
// concurrent authorized takeovers of the same worktree -- that is a much
// narrower race than the collision above, and the claim revalidation gate
// (re-reading the GitHub claim-id before every mutation, independent of this
// lock) is the real authority there: GitHub claim parsing is deterministic,
// so only one concurrent takeover's claim-id can actually be the active one,
// regardless of what this local lock file happens to contain.
//
// Generated-tokens record (#2719): a second, sibling on-disk artifact in
// the same admin directory, answering a narrower question than the lock
// above -- not "does anyone else hold this worktree" but "did *this*
// session actually generate the agent-id/claim-id it is about to trust,
// on disk, independent of (possibly compacted) conversation memory."
// Keyed by claim-id rather than a single fixed filename because the
// *first* write happens at A5 claim time, before the B1 worktree exists --
// the current cwd is then the primary worktree, whose admin directory is
// shared by every concurrent session in the same clone. A fixed filename
// there would let two sessions generating two different claim-ids clobber
// each other; a claim-id-keyed filename (plus a short content hash suffix,
// so sanitization collapsing two distinct claim-ids to the same string
// still resolves to different paths in all but an astronomically unlikely
// collision -- an 8-hex-char truncated hash cannot make that provably
// impossible) makes that far less likely. B1 repeats the same write into
// the new worktree's own private admin directory once it exists,
// mirroring how `idd-claim.lock` already works there. Unlike the lock,
// this record has no collision or
// `--takeover` concept: it is per-claim-id evidence, not a mutual-exclusion
// primitive, so re-recording (idempotent overwrite) is always safe and
// expected -- both writes above, plus the follow-up write once the
// activation-nonce is minted, target the same path for a given cwd.
//
// This record does not itself replace GitHub claim state as authority.
// The GitHub claim-id parse (`idd-overview-core.instructions.md`'s Claim
// revalidation gate) always stays authoritative for *whether* a claim is
// active; this record answers a narrower question that gate alone cannot:
// whether the claim-id it finds active is one this session actually
// generated, rather than one merely recalled from (possibly compacted)
// conversation context.
//
// Backfill recovery route (#2884): an adopter who upgrades their
// `idd-template/` copy to gain the generated-tokens-record feature while a
// claim already has its B1 worktree (created before this feature existed)
// never reruns the claim-posting sequence or B1, so no generated-tokens
// record is ever created in that worktree -- every subsequent
// `--read-tokens` check then fails closed forever, even though the
// session still legitimately owns the claim (PR #2879 review, Codex P1).
// `--backfill-tokens` closes that gap by trusting the worktree's own
// `idd-claim.lock` file instead of a live GitHub round-trip: that lock
// already carries the legitimate `agentId` for exactly this scenario, and
// is mechanically verifiable on disk rather than relying on the current
// session's own (possibly compacted) recollection. It writes only when
// the lock is present and its own `claimId` matches the caller's
// `--claim-id` exactly; an absent, malformed, or mismatched lock all fail
// closed with a distinct status and write nothing. The caller -- the
// Claim revalidation gate's documented recovery route -- is responsible
// for having already independently confirmed the live claim-id via
// GitHub before ever reaching this step; this command itself never makes
// a GitHub round-trip, matching `--acquire`'s own same-machine, no-network
// design.
//
// Generated-tokens write lock (#2922): `--backfill-tokens` preserves an
// existing record's own `nonce` by reading it, then writing the backfilled
// record back with that captured value -- a read-modify-write with nothing
// serializing it against a concurrent plain `--record-tokens --nonce` call
// (the activation-nonce minting flow's own second write) landing in
// between. Because every write to this file was previously a plain
// `atomicReplaceFile` replace, not a compare-and-swap, that interleaving
// could silently clobber a fresher nonce with the stale value the backfill
// captured moments earlier. Both call sites now share one
// `withGeneratedTokensWriteLock` critical section, keyed by the record's
// own path: a same-directory `.writelock` guard file created via a plain
// `wx`-flag exclusive create (existence alone needs no atomic-visibility
// trick, unlike the claim lock body `linkSync` closes for #2920 above --
// nothing ever reads this guard file's content). This makes the two writers
// fully mutually exclusive rather than merely narrowing the window: a
// concurrent write either completes entirely before the backfill's read
// (and is correctly preserved) or entirely after its write (a normal,
// non-lossy last-writer-wins overwrite), never in between. A guard file
// orphaned by a killed process (rather than released via a normal
// `finally`) fails every future write against that claim-id closed with a
// clear recovery message rather than silently reclaiming itself: an
// earlier revision self-reclaimed a guard old enough (by file modification
// time) to have outlived one full wait budget, but three independent
// reviewers (Codex, Copilot, CodeRabbit) flagged that as its own ABA race
// -- two callers can both classify the same guard as stale, and the
// second's unconditional unlink can delete the first reclaimer's fresh
// replacement (or a still-live holder's own guard), letting both enter
// the critical section at once and reintroducing the exact clobber this
// lock exists to prevent. Closing that safely needs a real
// compare-and-swap or ownership-token primitive this file does not yet
// have, so failing closed -- explicit operator cleanup required -- is the
// safer default for now.
//
// Scope of the ownership proof (#2879 review, Codex P1): a `present: true`
// `--read-tokens` result proves "a `--record-tokens` call for this exact
// claim-id landed at this path" -- it does not cryptographically bind that
// call to the specific process or conversation now reading it back, since
// each CLI invocation is a stateless one-shot child (see above) with no
// tracked process/session identity to check against. During the narrow
// A5-to-B1 window, the primary worktree's admin directory is shared by
// every concurrent session in the same clone, so a `--read-tokens` check
// made *against that shared path* is corroborating bootstrap evidence,
// not sole proof of current-session ownership. This is why every caller
// must resolve `--read-tokens`/`--acquire` against its **own current
// cwd** (never an explicit different worktree's path): once B1 creates
// the dedicated worktree, that admin directory is private to the one
// claim/branch it represents, and the pre-mutation claim revalidation
// gate (`idd-overview-core.instructions.md`) already scopes its own
// cwd-vs-claim check to exactly that post-B1 contract (B3, D, E, F2/F3),
// where this record's guarantee is strongest. The existing GitHub
// claim-state, branch-collision, and worktree-local-lock checks remain
// the primary defense against a genuinely different session mutating
// under a claim-id it never generated; this record's own job is narrower
// and complementary: helping *this* session's own memory survive its own
// context compaction, not adjudicating between two sessions.

 * clobbers that fresher nonce with the stale value it captured moments
 * earlier. Both call sites resolve to the same lock path for the same
 * `(cwd, claimId)` pair (they share {@link resolveGeneratedTokensPath}), so
 * true mutual exclusion holds between them: a plain write either completes
 * entirely before backfill's read (and backfill observes it, preserving its
 * nonce correctly) or entirely after backfill's write (and simply
 * overwrites, which is the expected, non-lossy last-writer-wins outcome --
 * never a write landing invisibly *inside* backfill's own read-then-write
 * window).
 *
 * **Scope: writers only, not a general readers/writers lock** (#2922
 * review, Copilot). A standalone {@link readGeneratedClaimTokens} /
 * {@link readGeneratedTokensAtPath} call made *outside* another write's own
 * `critical` callback is never guarded by this lock -- only the two
 * call sites that mutate the record (this file's own `recordGeneratedClaimTokens`
 * and `backfillGeneratedClaimTokens`) participate. On Windows,
 * {@link atomicReplaceFile}'s existing-file branch removes the old target
 * before renaming the replacement in (see that function's own doc
 * comment, and `overwriteLockAtomically`'s identical, pre-existing gap
 * for the claim lock file above), so an unguarded concurrent read can in
 * principle observe a transient `absent` during any write to this record,
 * with or without this lock. That gap predates this lock and is
 * unrelated to the nonce-clobber race it closes; guarding reads too (or
 * changing the read contract to rule out a transient `absent`) is a
 * separate, broader design question out of scope for #2922.
 *
 * `critical` must call only the unlocked write primitive
 * ({@link writeGeneratedClaimTokensRecord}), never the locked
 * {@link recordGeneratedClaimTokens} wrapper -- this guard is not
 * re-entrant, and nesting would deadlock a caller against itself.
 *
 * No *contending* reader ever needs to inspect the guard file's content
 * before the creator finishes writing and closes it -- unlike the claim
 * lock's `linkSync`-based fresh-create fix (#2920), which exists
 * specifically so a *third-party reader* never observes a torn body -- so a
 * plain `wx`-flag exclusive create is sufficient here: POSIX and Windows
 * both make `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` (`CREATE_NEW`) atomic for existence alone,
 * with no partial-content window to close. (This creator's *own* later
 * release does read the body back, to verify the token it wrote at create
 * time is still present -- see {@link releaseGeneratedTokensWriteLockIfOwned}
 * -- #2922 review round 11, Copilot; only a torn-body window relevant to a
 * different reader is what this paragraph rules out.)
 *
 * The create step uses {@link openSync}/{@link writeSync}/{@link closeSync}
 * directly, rather than a single {@link writeFileSync} call, specifically to
 * track ownership precisely (#2922 review round 5, Copilot): only a
 * *successful* `openSync(path, 'wx')` proves this call exclusively created
 * `lockPath` and is its sole owner from that instant on, so only a failure
 * *after* that point (finishing the write, or closing the descriptor) is
 * safe to clean up with an unlink. A failure *at* `openSync` itself (for
 * example `EMFILE`/`ENFILE`, transient descriptor exhaustion) proves the
 * opposite -- nothing was created by this call -- so nothing is touched;
 * unlinking there could delete a different, possibly concurrent, holder's
 * genuine guard, landing right back in the same ABA-race territory as the
 * stale-guard reclaim already removed below. An earlier revision used the
 * single-call `writeFileSync(path, ..., { flag: 'wx' })` form and cleaned
 * up on *any* non-`EEXIST` error, which could not tell these two cases
 * apart.
 *
 * Fails closed after {@link GENERATED_TOKENS_WRITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS} rather
 * than self-reclaiming an aged guard (#2922 review -- Codex, Copilot, and
 * CodeRabbit each independently flagged a since-removed timeout-then-unlink
 * reclaim path as an ABA race: two callers can both classify the same
 * guard as stale, and an unconditional `unlinkSync` by the second can
 * delete the first reclaimer's freshly created replacement -- or a still
 * genuinely live holder's own guard -- letting two callers enter this
 * critical section at once, reintroducing the exact clobber this lock
 * exists to prevent). An orphaned guard (left behind by a process killed
 * between acquiring it and reaching its own `finally` release) therefore
 * requires explicit operator cleanup -- removing the reported path -- per
 * the thrown error's own recovery instructions, rather than an automatic
 * reclaim this codebase cannot yet prove safe without a real
 * compare-and-swap or ownership-token primitive.
 *
 * Both releases below (the `critical()`-failure cleanup and the
 * `critical()`-success release) are **token-verified**, not a bare
 * `unlinkSync(lockPath)` (#2922 review round 10, Copilot): each acquisition
 * writes a fresh random token into the guard body, and release re-reads the
 * guard and only unlinks it when that same token is still present. This
 * mirrors this repository's own existing precedent for exactly this
 * problem -- `releaseCloneLock` in `clone-lock.mts` -- which likewise
 * refuses to remove a lock file whose recorded `token` no longer matches
 * the releasing handle's own. Without this check, a guard manually removed
 * by an operator (per the timeout error's own recovery instructions) while
 * the original holder's `critical()` is still genuinely running could be
 * recreated by a new writer before the original holder's release runs;
 * that release would then delete the *new* writer's guard instead of a
 * guard it actually owns, letting two writers believe they hold exclusive
 * access at once -- the same class of hazard already solved on the
 * acquire side (see the `openSync`/`writeSync`/`closeSync` ownership
 * comment above), now closed on the release side too.
 *
 * This narrows the guard-recreation window rather than eliminating it:
 * the same kind of race could still, in principle, land *between* the
 * token read and the `unlinkSync` call the check guards, because no
 * `wx`-only filesystem primitive gives a true atomic compare-and-delete.
 * Closing that residual sliver would need a real compare-and-swap or
 * `flock(2)`-style primitive this module deliberately avoids taking on
 * (see the header comment). It is accepted as a known limitation: it only
 * matters when a live holder's own guard is manually removed while that
 * holder's `critical()` is still running -- a precondition violation of
 * the timeout error's own recovery instructions -- and #2922's Acceptance
 * Criteria only ever covers nonce-preservation under normal concurrent
 * operation, not safety after an operator has manually intervened on a

Worktree-local lock file: a same-machine fast path that complements the
cross-machine activation-nonce claim check. Resolves the lock file inside
<path>'s own private git-admin directory (\`git rev-parse
--absolute-git-dir\`), so \`git worktree remove\` deletes it together with
the worktree -- no separate release step is needed.

--acquire is idempotent for a matching --claim-id: it re-acquires
(confirms nobody else holds it) as a pure read, with no write and no GitHub
round-trip -- this is the fast path used before every mutation. A different
--claim-id is always reported as a collision, regardless of how old the
existing lock is: this helper never judges staleness locally. Pass
--takeover only after independently re-verifying live GitHub claim state
(e.g. via \`resume-claim-routing.mjs --fresh-claim-gate\` reporting
\`claimable\`, \`stale-reclaimable\`, or \`already-claimed\` with a
\`winning_claim_id\` that matches a \`claim-id\` the caller has already
independently verified as its own) to override a collision; \`holder\`
in the JSON output reports the previous occupant on both a plain collision
and an authorized takeover.

--check is read-only: it reports the current lock state without creating,
mutating, or deleting anything. \`malformed: true\` means a lock file
exists but could not be parsed as a well-formed lock body.

--record-tokens writes (creating or idempotently replacing) the
generated-tokens record (#2719) for --claim-id at <path>'s own private
git-admin directory -- a sibling artifact to the lock file above, keyed by
claim-id so it is safe to call before the B1 worktree exists (<path> is
then the primary worktree, whose admin directory is shared by every
concurrent session in the same clone). Call it once right after
generating --agent-id/--claim-id, before posting the \`claimed-by\`
marker, and again with --nonce right before posting the activation-nonce
marker. Unlike --acquire, this has no collision concept: re-invoking is
always a safe, expected overwrite.

--read-tokens is read-only: it reports whether --claim-id was actually
recorded on disk by this mechanism, distinguishing \`present\` (a
well-formed record whose own claim-id matches) from \`malformed\` (a
file exists at the resolved path but cannot be trusted as that claim-id's
record) from neither field set, meaning absent -- this claim-id was never
recorded (or was recorded under a different claim-id, which resolves to a
different path). Both \`malformed\` and absent must be treated the same
way by a caller checking ownership: never trust a claim-id this record
does not affirmatively confirm.

--backfill-tokens is the recovery route for a worktree whose
generated-tokens record was never created because its B1 worktree
predates the record feature: it reads the existing \`idd-claim.lock\` file
and, only when present with a --claim-id that matches exactly, writes the
generated-tokens record using the lock's own recorded agent-id, with no
--nonce unless an existing well-formed record for this --claim-id already
carries one, which is preserved rather than erased. An absent lock reports
\`lock-absent\`, an unparseable or
unreadable lock reports \`lock-malformed\`, a lock recorded for a
different claim-id reports \`lock-mismatch\` (naming the actual holder),
and a matching lock whose own record path is blocked by a directory
reports \`record-blocked\` (a matching lock authenticates the lock, not
that separate path, so this stays fail-closed rather than deleting it)
-- all four write nothing. A successful write reports \`backfilled\` and
exits 0; the four failure statuses exit 2, mirroring --acquire's own
collision exit-code contract so a caller can chain
\`--backfill-tokens && --read-tokens\`. Like --acquire, this performs no
GitHub round-trip -- the caller must have already independently confirmed
the live claim-id via GitHub before reaching this recovery step.
Re-invoking after a successful backfill is always a safe, idempotent
overwrite (reports \`backfilled\` again), matching --record-tokens's own
idempotency contract.
