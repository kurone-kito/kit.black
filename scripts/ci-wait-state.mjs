// Single-shot, read-only D-phase CI snapshot helper (#1317). Unlike the
// E/F review-state steps, which each have a committed evidence-snapshot
// helper (advisory-wait-state, pre-merge-readiness, review-activity-snapshot),
// the D-phase CI wait has historically had no committed polling/snapshot
// helper: callers re-derive check status from raw `statusCheckRollup` JSON
// by hand every wait. Two concrete traps this helper closes:
//
// - Duplicate check names across triggering workflows: a single PR can carry
//   two check runs with the identical display `name` (e.g. the same job name
//   once under a "push as feature branch" workflow and again under a "merge
//   as main branch" workflow). This helper keys every check entry by
//   `(checkName, workflowName)` so a naive "first match by name" read never
//   silently picks the wrong workflow's status.
// - HEAD drift mid-wait: this helper always reports the live `headRefOid` at
//   read time, so a caller polling in a loop can detect the branch moving
//   out from under an in-flight wait.

// required check name. Deriving from the shared set (instead of maintaining
// a second, separately-updated literal) is what keeps this file's wider

/**
 * Reduce `entries` to one representative per `checkName`, matching the

 * `protocol-helpers.mts`: GitHub can report several check-run instances
 * sharing one required check name (a manual or automatic rerun leaves the
 * earlier instance in the fetched rollup alongside the new one), and only
 * the latest instance per name should govern pass/fail/pending (#1478).
 * Reuses the exported `selectLatestCheckInstance` for the actual
 * same-name reduction (still-incomplete wins over completed; else latest
 * `completedAt` wins; a same-instant tie prefers any
 * `CI_FAILURE_CONCLUSION_STATES` member, then non-`CANCELLED`) so this file
 * does not maintain a second, independently-drifting copy of that
 * tie-break logic. Only the
 * name-keyed grouping below is local to this file, because
 * `CiWaitCheckEntry` uses `checkName` where `protocol-helpers.mts`'s
 * `CheckLike` uses `name`.
 *
 * `selectLatestCheckInstance`'s shared `ciStateTieRank` originally
 * special-cased only the two literal strings `'FAILURE'` and `'CANCELLED'`;
 * every other raw state -- including this file's own wider `FAILURE_STATES`
 * additions `TIMED_OUT`, `ACTION_REQUIRED`, `STARTUP_FAILURE`, `STALE`, and
 * `ERROR` -- fell into the shared tie-break's generic rank-1 bucket, where a
 * same-instant tie against a success-family state resolved by raw
 * lexicographic string comparison instead of "the failure should win"
 * (#1504). That was fixed locally only, in this file, at the time (a
 * tie-break-only state normalization applied by `selectLatestCheckEntry`
 * before calling `selectLatestCheckInstance`) -- widening `ciStateTieRank`
 * itself was left out of scope as "shared, upstream of `classifyCiChecks`".
 * #1688 closed that shared corner: `ciStateTieRank` now ranks every
 * `CI_FAILURE_CONCLUSION_STATES` member (which this file's `FAILURE_STATES`
 * is derived from) at 0 directly, so `selectLatestCheckEntry` no longer
 * needs a local normalization step at all -- see that function.
 *
 * Deliberately keyed by `checkName` alone, not the `(checkName,
 * workflowName)` pair this file otherwise disambiguates entries by (see
 * the module header): GitHub's own required-status-check gate matches by
 * check name alone, independent of which workflow produced a given
 * instance, so any rerun whose `workflowName` happens to differ from the
 * instance it supersedes would not be deduped under a workflow-qualified
 * key, leaving the defect only partially fixed. (The live PR #1434
 * reproduction this fix targets happens to share one `workflowName`
 * across every instance, so a composite key would also fix that specific
 * case -- but not the general one, and not as directly as matching
 * GitHub's own name-only semantics.) `required` itself is already
 * computed by `checkName` alone (see `normalizeCheckEntry`), so this
 * does not newly conflate anything the required-checks rollup did not
 * already conflate. Two genuinely independent, same-named required
 * checks that happen to complete in the same instant remain an accepted
 * limitation shared with `classifyCiChecks` (tracked in #1483).
 *
 * `entries` itself may be empty (e.g. no required check has been
 * reported yet), in which case `groups` simply ends up with zero
 * entries. What is guaranteed is that every group `selectLatestCheckEntry`
 * receives has at least one member: a group is only ever created by
 * pushing the entry that introduced its key (see the `Map` construction
 * below), so the seedless `reduce` inside `selectLatestCheckInstance`
 * never runs on an empty array.

 * member -- which is exactly this file's `FAILURE_STATES` minus `CANCELLED`
 * -- at 0, this file's own wider vocabulary already wins a same-instant tie
 * against a success-family state with no local help).
 *
