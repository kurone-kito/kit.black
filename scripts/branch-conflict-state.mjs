 * Bounded fetch-depth escalation steps tried by {@link computeMergeBase}'s
 * retry loop, in order. The first step (`--depth=1`) matches the
 * pre-existing single-shallow-fetch behavior byte-for-byte, so a checkout
 * that already resolves after one shallow fetch performs exactly the same
 * single extra fetch call as before this retry loop existed (#1519's "no
 * regression for the common case" requirement). Each later step widens
 * local history via `git fetch --deepen=<n>` -- relative to the current
 * shallow boundary, so repeated calls compose instead of re-fetching the
 * same fixed `--depth=N` -- instead of retrying forever. Three total
 * attempts mirrors the bounded-retry shape F1's `computing` re-poll budget
 * already uses elsewhere in this codebase (`idd-pre-merge.instructions.md`).
 *
 * Exported so tests can fetch with these exact args against a hermetic
 * local fixture remote (see `tests/branch-conflict-state.test.mts`'s
 * shallow-checkout fixture) instead of a hand-copied duplicate that could
 * silently drift from what `tryFetchBase` actually runs in production.
 *
 * Declared here, above the CLI entry block below, rather than next to
 * {@link computeMergeBase} that actually uses it: the entry block's
 * top-level `await` parks module evaluation there on the CLI path, so a
 * module-level `const` declared textually after it would still be in its
 * temporal dead zone the first time a helper reads it (see
 * `tests/cli-entry-smoke.test.mts`'s module-eval-order guard, #1447).

 *
 * - The base commit is missing (e.g. an agent worktree that has not fetched
 *   recent base history) -- {@link tryFetchBase} handles this, unchanged
 *   since #1519.
 * - The PR **head**'s own ancestry is missing (e.g. a shallow CI checkout of
 *   just the PR head, or a fork PR whose head commits were never fetched at
 *   all) -- {@link tryFetchHead} handles this by fetching/deepening
 *   `refs/pull/<prNumber>/head` from the same base-repository remote
 *   {@link tryFetchBase} already targets. GitHub mirrors every PR head onto
 *   the base repository under that ref (confirmed empirically against real
 *   GitHub-hosted repos, including a genuine fork PR, for #1535 -- see the
 *   PR description), so no separate fork remote URL is needed even when the
 *   head lives in a fork: `classifyBranchConflictState`'s existing
 *   `owner`/`repo` (the base repository) plus `prNumber` are sufficient.
 *
 * Each retry step attempts **both** fetches at the same escalating
 * depth/deepen args and widens history if **either** succeeds, so a
 * structural block on one side (e.g. a missing `prBaseRef`) does not stop
 * the other side's retries, and the loop only gives up early when neither
 * side can plausibly help.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the merge-base still cannot be resolved after
 * exhausting {@link MERGE_BASE_FETCH_STEPS}; callers decide how to report
 * that indeterminate outcome, since "conflict probe" and "base-advancement"
 * callers need different diagnostics wording for the same underlying null.

/**
 * Attempt one fetch of the PR **head** side at the given depth/deepen args,
 * for {@link computeMergeBase}'s bounded retry loop (via {@link
 * resolveMergeBaseWithRetry}) -- the #1535 sibling of {@link tryFetchBase}.
 *
 * Fetches `refs/pull/<prNumber>/head` from the same base-repository remote
 * `tryFetchBase` already targets, rather than the PR's own `headRefName` or
 * a fork's own remote URL. GitHub creates and keeps this ref updated on the
 * **base** repository for every pull request -- including from a fork, and
 * even when the fork remote has since been renamed, made private, or
 * deleted -- so it is fetchable with the exact same remote URL, the exact
 * same (anonymous, credential-helper-backed) auth, and the exact same
 * escalating depth/deepen args as the base-ref fetch, with no separate
 * fork-remote resolution required. Confirmed empirically for #1535 against
 * real GitHub-hosted repos (both a same-repository PR and a genuine
 * cross-repository/fork PR): `git ls-remote <repo> refs/pull/<n>/head`
 * matches `gh pr view --json headRefOid` exactly, and fetching that ref
 * (progressively deepened, mirroring {@link MERGE_BASE_FETCH_STEPS}) lets a
 * shallow clone that never had the PR head's ancestry at all resolve
 * `git merge-base` against it -- see the PR description for the full
 * experiment. Because this always fetches a normally-advertised ref (never
 * a bare, unadvertised SHA), it needs no server-side
 * `uploadpack.allow*SHA1InWant` support either.
 *
 * Returns `true` when the `git fetch` call itself succeeded, so the
 * caller's retry loop knows a deeper next step could plausibly still help;
 * returns `false` when preconditions (`prNumber`, `owner`, `repo`) are
 * missing or malformed, or when the fetch itself failed (network, auth,
 * unknown ref, etc.) -- in either case a further attempt against the same
 * unreachable/absent target would not change the outcome.
