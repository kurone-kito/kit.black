 * literal `${` sequence of its own, so there is no collision risk with
 * the outer `.mts` template-literal interpolation to guard against here,
 * unlike the watchdog's longer, multiply-interpolated PowerShell
 * one-liner.
 *
 * **The relay's own environment is sanitized of `NODE_OPTIONS`**
 * (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2910 review, Copilot): the relay is itself a
 * `node` process, so if it inherited the caller's raw `NODE_OPTIONS`
 * directly, an inherited `--require`/`--import` would execute arbitrary
 * preload code *inside the relay* before it ever forwards the payload --
 * confirmed as a real mechanism, not merely hypothetical, by this
 * repository's own win32 test stubs, which rely on exactly that
 * `--require <preload>` pattern to inject their behavior (see
 * `tests/test-utils.mts`'s `stubExecutable`). `invokeCritiqueTelemetryHook`
 * below therefore does not pass the caller's own `NODE_OPTIONS` through
 * to the relay's environment at all -- the relay's own process runs
 * without any inherited `NODE_OPTIONS`, with `--input-type=commonjs`
 * (kept as defense-in-depth even though the vector it originally guarded
 * against, an inherited `--input-type=module`, is now also closed by
 * this sanitization). The caller's *original* `NODE_OPTIONS` value still
 * needs to reach the real target command two hops down -- POSIX and the
 * pre-#2910 win32 path both let it through unchanged, and this fix must
 * not narrow that existing contract -- so it travels through the
 * separate {@link WIN32_RELAY_NODE_OPTIONS_ENV} channel instead, applied
 * only to the inner spawn's own environment, never executed by the relay
 * itself.
 *
 * Root cause (verified live on native Windows 11): on win32, `shell:
 * true` wraps the primary spawn in `cmd.exe` (on POSIX the equivalent
 * wrapper is `/bin/sh`, unaffected by any of this -- this whole defect
 * and fix are win32-only). Before this fix, the primary spawn used that
 * `cmd.exe` wrapper unconditionally on win32 too, and `cmd.exe` never
 * relays a piped stdin payload to the further child it execs when
 * `cmd.exe` itself runs under Win32's `DETACHED_PROCESS` creation flag
 * (what `detached: true` maps to) -- confirmed at every payload size from 0B
 * to 500KB+, and for a non-Node consumer piped the same way, isolating
 * the fault to `cmd.exe`'s own stdin-relay plumbing under
 * `DETACHED_PROCESS` rather than anything Node/libuv- or payload-size-
 * specific. This is the same "`DETACHED_PROCESS` breaks a
 * console-subsystem process's own I/O/message-pump initialization"
 * pattern already root-caused for {@link spawnWatchdogWindows}'s own
 * `powershell.exe` hop (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2892 / PR #2897),
 * recurring for `cmd.exe`'s stdin relay instead of `powershell.exe`'s
 * ConsoleHost startup.
 *
 * Fix shape: this script is itself spawned *directly* (`shell: false`)
 * as a `node.exe` child under `detached: true` -- confirmed live to
 * deliver a piped stdin payload correctly, at every size from 0B to
 * 500KB+, once the caller waits for the stream to fully close before
 * exiting (this file's `onPayloadDelivered` contract already does
 * exactly that). It then reads its own stdin to completion, and only
 * *then* re-spawns the real `command` through `shell: true` -- but,
 * deliberately, NOT `detached` this time: this relay process itself is
 * what now needs to survive the CLI's `process.exit()`, not the
 * `cmd.exe` hop underneath it, so `cmd.exe` here is a normal
 * (non-`DETACHED_PROCESS`) child and does not hit the stdin-relay
 * defect above. The relay forwards the buffered payload to that
 * child's stdin (with the relay-command env var above scrubbed from
 * that inner spawn's own environment, so the configured `command`
 * never sees an env var it didn't configure) and exits with the same
 * code, preserving `invokeCritiqueTelemetryHook`'s existing
 * `ok: code === 0` contract for its caller unchanged.
 *
 * `child.pid` (what this file's timeout/kill/watchdog logic already
 * operates on generically -- see {@link killProcessGroup}) becomes
 * this relay's pid on win32. Verified live: a
 * `taskkill /PID <relay-pid> /T /F` (the existing
 * {@link killProcessTreeWindows} call, unchanged) still reaches and
 * kills the whole chain -- relay -> `cmd.exe` -> real target -- for
 * both an already-settled chain and a genuinely hung target, so no
 * change is needed to {@link killProcessGroup},
 * {@link killProcessTreeWindows}, or either `spawnWatchdog*` function.
 *
 * Never throws from the relay's own perspective: a synchronous spawn
 * failure or an async `'error'`/non-zero exit all resolve to
 * `finish(1)` (a non-ok result for the caller), matching this file's
 * "never throws" contract for the primary hook spawn. Like every other
 * failure mode this file already absorbs silently (a bad command, a
 * non-zero exit, a timeout), a defect in this script's own body would
 * also fail silently in production (its `stdio` discards stderr) --
 * an accepted extension of the existing contract, not a new risk;
 * the same gap already exists for the inline PowerShell watchdog
 * script below, with no unit-level syntax check for either. The tests
 * this issue adds are the mitigation, run for real (not just
 * argument-shape asserted) both locally, via the `platform: 'win32'`
 * override tests below, and on native `windows-latest` CI.

 * real process-*tree* kill via `taskkill /T` (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2892).
 * On win32, `child` is the primary spawn's own top-level process:
 * `cmd.exe` (the `shell: true` wrapper) directly, on POSIX and, before
 * kurone-kito/idd-skill#2910, on win32 too; since that fix, the win32
 * `child` is instead the relay process (see `WIN32_RELAY_SCRIPT`), which
 * itself wraps `cmd.exe` as its own child one level further down. Either
 * way, the actual invoked command sits one or more levels beneath `child`,
 * never reachable by terminating `child` alone -- which is exactly what
 * this file's previous Windows fallback (`child.kill('SIGKILL')` below)
 * only ever did, leaving that further descendant (and its own
 * auto-allocated console window) orphaned. `taskkill /T`'s tree-kill
 * reaches the whole subtree regardless of its depth beneath `child`, so
 * this function needs no depth-specific knowledge of which shape `child`
 * is. Never throws.
 *
 * Also used by {@link cancelWatchdog} to disarm the watchdog's own process
 * (itself `detached: true` -- see {@link spawnWatchdogPosix} /

 * primary, JS-level timer in {@link invokeCritiqueTelemetryHook} cannot
 * fire from a dead process either -- see that function's own comment on
 * why this backup exists in the first place).
 *
 * Spawns `powershell.exe` (Windows PowerShell 5.1, present on every
 * Windows install since 7 SP1 / Server 2008 R2 -- not `pwsh`/PowerShell
 * Core, whose presence is not guaranteed) through a `cmd.exe` hop
 * (`shell: true`), **not** directly (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2892, #2897 CI
 * follow-up, confirmed live on native Windows 11): `spawnFn('powershell.exe',
 * [...], { detached: true, stdio: 'ignore' })` -- no shell hop -- exits in
 * roughly 70-140ms with code 0 and never runs its `-Command`/`-File`
 * script at all, a false "success." Verified with the quoting variable
 * removed entirely (a `-File <script.ps1>` invocation, so no `-Command`
 * string-escaping is involved): still a same-result no-op under
 * `detached: true`, while the identical `-File` invocation through a
 * `cmd.exe` hop runs correctly and survives the caller's own
 * `process.exit()`. This isolates the cause to `DETACHED_PROCESS` itself
 * (no console object at all) breaking `powershell.exe`'s ConsoleHost
 * startup, not this file's own command construction -- adding the
 * `cmd.exe` hop back (as this file's primary hook spawn already uses for
 * `command`) is the fix. The extra process layer this reintroduces is
 * bounded: {@link cancelWatchdog}'s win32 tree-kill already uses
 * `taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F` (the `/T` flag), which reaches this
 * watchdog's own `cmd.exe` wrapper *and* the `powershell.exe` it spawns,
 * so disarming an early-settling hook's watchdog is unaffected by the
 * extra hop.
 *
 * `timeout.exe` is deliberately not used for the sleep: with
 * `stdio: 'ignore'` it fails outright ("Input redirection is not
 * supported"). `Start-Sleep -Seconds <n>` (a PowerShell built-in cmdlet,
 * not a further child process) is the sleep primitive instead.
 *
 * The kill step builds a `System.Diagnostics.Process` directly
 * (`UseShellExecute = $false; CreateNoWindow = $true`) rather than
 * `Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden` (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2897 CI
 * finding, `windows-latest`): an earlier `windows-latest` CI round already
 * showed this watchdog not actually killing its target before the
 * `DETACHED_PROCESS` no-op above was isolated as the real cause; kept here
 * regardless since `UseShellExecute = $false` is the same underlying
 * mechanism Node's own `windowsHide` option (and this file's
 * already-confirmed-working `killProcessTreeWindows`) relies on, so both
 * `taskkill` call sites stay on the same, empirically-working
 * process-creation path instead of two different ones. `.Arguments` (a
 * single space-joined string), not the array-based `.ArgumentList`: the
 * latter requires .NET Core 2.1+, unavailable on `powershell.exe`
 * (Windows PowerShell 5.1's .NET Framework runtime). `$p.WaitForExit()`
 * keeps this whole script's own execution (and thus the watchdog process)
 * alive until `taskkill` actually finishes, matching the POSIX version's
 * `sleep <n>; kill ...` sequencing.
 *
 * **Known residual, not present on the POSIX side**: {@link
 * cancelWatchdog}'s PID-reuse-race argument (see {@link
 * spawnWatchdogPosix}'s own doc comment) relies on POSIX pid/pgid reuse
 * requiring the entire process group to exit, be reaped, *and* a full
 * `pid_max` wrap before the number can be reused. Windows recycles freed
 * PIDs far faster (observably within seconds under process churn, nothing
 * resembling a full namespace wrap), so the residual window where a
 * quick-exit hook's watchdog stays armed against an already-freed pid for
 * the rest of `timeoutMs` is measurably wider here. `cancelWatchdog`
 * disarming this watchdog as soon as the hook settles (unchanged from the
 * POSIX path) is what actually bounds this in practice, not any
 * Windows-side pid-reuse guarantee -- an unexplained Windows-only flake in
 * a quick-exit test is the first place to look.
 *
 * Never throws: spawn failure here (no `cmd.exe`/`powershell.exe`
 * resolvable -- essentially never on a real Windows install) silently
 * forfeits this backup, the same accepted gap {@link spawnWatchdogPosix}
 * documents for a bare environment with no POSIX shell.

Resolves the effective C-phase \`critiqueLoop.telemetryHook\` the same way
resolveEffectiveCritiqueLoopTelemetryHook does: repository-local
.github/idd/config.json's critiqueLoop.telemetryHook wins outright (a
configured object, an explicit null disable, or a malformed value all
stop there); only when it is entirely absent does an optional
user-global $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/idd-skill/config.json (or
$HOME/.config/idd-skill/config.json) fragment apply; absent both, no
hook is usable. Under GITHUB_ACTIONS=true the user-global layer is
always skipped, matching the documented remote-agent-surface contract;
pass --no-user-global to skip it explicitly on any other remote surface
the caller recognizes but this helper cannot auto-detect.

Without --invoke, prints the resolution report:
{
  "usable": true,
  "source": "repository-local|user-global|none",
  "command": "..." | null,
  "reason": null | "repository-local-explicit-disable|invalid-repository-local-telemetry-hook|not-configured"
}

With --invoke, reads a JSON payload from stdin and, only if a hook
resolved as usable, invokes its command with that payload written to
the child's stdin. Fire-and-forget: a missing command, non-zero exit,
timeout, or any other failure is silently ignored. This mode always
exits 0 and never writes to stdout/stderr -- unlike critiqueLoop.delegate,
this command's result is never meant to be inspected by its caller.
