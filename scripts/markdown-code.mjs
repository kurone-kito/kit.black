 *
 * Two passes, per the CommonMark distinction the shared
 * {@link HtmlBlockScanState} type documents:
 *
 * 1. **Bounded backward collection.** Walk backward from
 *    `openingLineStart` through consecutive same-depth lines (list-marker-
 *    stripped, the same way the opening line's own marker already is,
 *    which is what makes this scan reachable from a bare, blockquote-free
 *    list item too, per #1894's follow-up fix, not only from inside a
 *    blockquote). A container-depth change stops collection unconditionally
 *    -- a block-type hypothesis from a different depth never reaches
 *    `openingLineStart`.
 * 2. **Forward, single-pass state tracking** over the collected lines (now
 *    in document order, oldest first): thread exactly one
 *    {@link HtmlBlockScanState} through them. Only a `none` state ever
 *    considers opening a new hypothesis (via {@link specialHtmlBlockCloseToken}
 *    and {@link isSelfClosedSpecialHtmlBlock} for the special forms, the
 *    existing `!isHtmlClosingSyntax` guard preserved for the generic
 *    branch so a lone closing tag like `</div>` still doesn't count as an
 *    opener); once a state other than `none` is active, only that family's
 *    own close condition can end it -- nothing else changes it. Returning
 *    the final state's non-`none`-ness is what resolves the ambiguity a
 *    single backward short-circuit scan could not: a literal `</script>`
 *    encountered while `special` is active is never misread as a raw-text
 *    close, and a blank line encountered while `special` or `raw-text` is
 *    active never ends it (only `generic` closes on a blank line).
 *
 * `findMarkdownBlockBoundary` now calls this scan whenever an active list
 * zone is involved, not only inside a blockquote -- including when the
 * opening line itself looks like a fresh list-item opener: the scan still
 * runs there (it does not know or care whether its own starting
 * line has a marker; only the *lines it walks backward
 * through* have their own markers stripped before testing). Since #1896's
 * fix, a `true` result forces the enclosing code span to never form at all
 * (an unconditional block boundary), rather than merely gating the
 * `isLazyListContinuation` / `isLazyQuoteContinuation` laziness exception
 * for later lines -- *unless* the opening line is a genuine fresh sibling
 * list-item opener (its own marker, and not itself still within an
 * earlier, outer list item's content zone; see the guard in
 * `findMarkdownBlockBoundary` below), in which case only the laziness-gate
 * consumption still applies, so a legitimate same-line span opened by that
 * fresh sibling right after an unclosed tag in the previous item is not
 * destroyed.
 *
 * **Deliberate side effect.** A stray raw-text-close-shaped line (e.g. a
 * bare `</script>`) encountered while the state is still `none` -- no raw-
 * text block open at all -- is now inert rather than ending the scan. This
 * only changes the observable result when a genuine opener (raw-text,
 * special, or generic) is reachable further back past the stray closer: the
 * old scan returned "not enclosed" as soon as it saw the closer, regardless
 * of state, so it never reached that opener; the new scan correctly
 * continues past it and finds the still-open block. With no such opener
 * reachable, both scans agree (nothing was ever open to end). Verified
 * empirically both ways; covered by the last two cases in
 * `tests/markdown-code.test.mts`'s #1895 section.
 *
 * `earliestLineStart` (PR #1902 review finding): an optional lower bound on
 * how far back this scan may walk. The scan otherwise has no concept of a
 * list-item boundary -- it walks backward purely by same-`containerDepth`
 * lines -- so, unbounded, it can reach *past* a genuine sibling list-item
 * opener into an earlier, unrelated item's own open HTML block (a fresh
 * sibling's own line does not reset `containerDepth`, only its list-content
 * indent does, which this function does not track). `findMarkdownBlockBoundary`
 * passes the nearest enclosing list zone's own opener line (or the opening
 * line itself, when no such zone reaches it) whenever an active list zone
 * is involved; omitted (unbounded) for the pure-blockquote case, where no
 * sibling-item boundary concept applies and unbounded reachability across
 * shape-only lines is the CommonMark-correct behavior already relied on by
 * `tests/markdown-code.test.mts`'s pre-#1896 blockquote coverage.

 * Codex review, PR #2840: an issue can place example Markdown (a fake
 * `## Acceptance criteria` heading plus a checklist, or a fake
 * `## Candidate files` entry) inside a raw HTML block such as `<pre>`,
 * which GitHub renders as literal/opaque content, not Markdown structure --
 * neither {@link findFencedCodeRanges}, {@link findIndentedCodeRanges}, nor
 * {@link findHtmlCommentRanges} masked that shape.
 *
 * Opener detection strips a container prefix first (Codex review, PR
 * #2840, round 11): `- <pre>` (an HTML block opener as a list item's own
 * first line) or `> <pre>` (inside a blockquote) previously tested the
 * *unstripped* line against every opener pattern below, all of which are
 * anchored at `^ {0,3}<`, so the leading marker made every one of them
 * miss -- the block's opaque content stayed fully unmasked, letting a
 * fake heading/checklist/candidate-path inside it satisfy a structural
 * signal GitHub itself never renders as real structure. Reuses
 * {@link parseContainerLine} (blockquote `>` stripping) and
 * {@link stripListItemMarker} (list-marker stripping) -- the same helpers
 * {@link findMarkdownBlockBoundary} already uses for this exact
 * "container-prefix-aware opener" question -- rather than inventing new
 * machinery.
 *
 * Every close/end scan (a raw-text tag's own closing tag, a special
 * block's close token, a generic block's next blank line) additionally
 * stops at the opener's own enclosing container boundary (Codex review,
 * PR #2840, round 15; {@link isHtmlBlockContainerEnded}): an unclosed
 * raw-text/special block that opens inside a blockquote or list item
 * (`> <pre>` with no matching `</pre>` anywhere in `text`) previously
 * scanned all the way to a real closing tag or end of text, masking any
 * genuine Acceptance-criteria/Candidate-files content that renders
 * *outside* the block once its enclosing container itself ends --
 * `gh api /markdown` confirms GitHub closes an unclosed HTML block at
 * its container's own end, never leaking past it.
 *
 * A custom-tag opener (`MARKDOWN_CUSTOM_HTML_BLOCK_START_PATTERN`, which
 * per CommonMark cannot interrupt a paragraph) is additionally eligible
 * when this line opens a *fresh* list item container (Codex review, PR
 * #2840, round 13): `stripListItemMarker` strips a marker only when one
 * is present, so `content !== containerContent` means this line is a
 * list item's own first line, which has no "previous line" inside that
 * new container for the interruption rule to apply to -- the same
 * reasoning `noOpenParagraph` already covers for the top-level case.
 *
 * `fencedRanges` (Codex review, PR #2840, round 14; same
 * caller-supplied-ranges convention {@link findIndentedCodeRanges} already
 * uses for the identical purpose) lets a caller exclude fenced-code-block
 * content from opener/closer detection: an unclosed raw-text tag such as
 * `<pre>` *inside* a fenced example is literal example text, not a real
 * HTML block opener, but a scan of the raw line text alone cannot tell the
 * difference -- without this, that literal `<pre>` opened a raw-text block
 * with no real closing tag anywhere in `text`, extending the returned
 * range through the remainder of the body and masking any genuine
 * Acceptance-criteria/Candidate-files content after the fence. Must be in
